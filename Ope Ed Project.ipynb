      "['Good evening, and sincere thanks to the Atlantic Council, Le Figaro, and the Tocqueville Foundation for organizing this important conversation about Democracy in the West.\\xa0', 'I enjoyed catching up with Atlantic council board member and a long-time friend Ambassador Boyden Gray and the Atlantic Council’s Executive Vice President Damon Wilson just a few minutes ago.', 'Jeff Gedmin and I were also able to spend a few minutes together – both of us were previously posted in Berlin.', 'Last but certainly not least I would like to \\xa0acknowledge former U.S. Ambassador to France and my close friend Craig Stapleton, who is here tonight.\\xa0 Craig, a member of the board of directors for the Tocqueville foundation is the reason I am here.\\xa0\\xa0', 'So if you don’t like or agree with my remarks today, you can blame Craig.', 'There is no better venue to address the issue of democracy in the West than here in Normandy.', 'Duty prevented me from attending the D-Day ceremony, where Allied forces landed on the nearby beaches to liberate the continent. \\xa0It was on this ground, in those uncertain days, where decisive action was required and blood was shed to protect our threatened democracies.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0', 'And a century before that, Normandy was home to the famed 19th\\xa0century French philosopher of democracy in America.\\xa0', 'The writings of Alexis De Tocqueville and the on-going work of the Tocqueville foundation has helped generations of Americans better understand the American political experiment.\\xa0\\xa0', 'As a stranger in a strange land, his insights on US society, culture, politics, and institutions still strike contemporary readers as prescient and powerful.\\xa0', 'For the rest of the world—including his fellow French citizens—his work still provides an early warning of the challenges and opportunities offered by the growth of democracy and political equality.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0', 'I can’t help but wonder what Tocqueville would assess if he returned to America today?\\xa0', 'To be sure, he would see a democracy that is messy and flawed.\\xa0 As Winston Churchill said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those others that have been tried from time to time.”\\xa0', 'But Tocqueville would also see that our democratic experiment has endured many challenges, not least of which include a civil war, two world wars, a cold war, numerous regional conflicts, terrorist attacks, and foreign efforts to undermine our democratic process.\\xa0', 'Together we have successfully met these challenges at great cost of lives and treasure.\\xa0', 'My purpose at this conference is to explore how we can continue and strengthen our democracies to ensure they endure for future generations.\\xa0', 'I’ll approach this question through the lens of my role as the leader of the U.S. Intelligence Community.', 'In my current position, my responsibility is to focus on foreign threats to our democracy – and refrain from commenting on politics in the U.S.\\xa0 It is not pretty.', 'Frankly, I welcome this limitation.\\xa0 As a former U.S. Senator and member of the House of Representatives, I am acutely aware of the current state of U.S. politics.', 'So in the context of my current position, I’ll offer my perspective on two topics:', 'One is the foundational role of intelligence in understanding the foreign threats to our democracies - and I’ll talk particularly about the threat from Russia.\\xa0', 'And the second is the importance of enduring relationships and information-sharing with our European allies in the face of these threats.\\xa0', 'As I see every day in our intelligence reports, we live in a time of uncertainty, turmoil and peril for western democracies.', 'From Russia’s renewed aggression, to China’s global ambitions, to the persistent threat of terrorism, democracy and faith in our national institutions are under assault.', 'In addressing these threats, our role in the Intelligence Community is to gain understanding of these threats and provide essential insights to our policymakers.', 'It requires that we produce objective, unvarnished, non-political assessments.\\xa0', 'And it requires that we tune out the daily political controversies and maintain focus on current challenges and the looming threats on the horizon.\\xa0', 'In our business, we must adhere to the very foundational basis for intelligence agencies.', 'By that I mean we must seek and speak the truth, offer facts and assessments based on facts, but not opinions.\\xa0\\xa0', 'I consistently remind our workforce to remain focused on the mission, regardless of the political environment.\\xa0', 'While our work is largely a human endeavor and therefore can be flawed, we strive to be seekers of the truth - to understand the world as it is, rather than how we would like it to be.\\xa0\\xa0', 'At our best, we help to frame debates, set the parameters for discussions, and present a core set of facts and assessments, all of which serves as the basis for our leaders to make informed decisions.\\xa0', 'This is our goal – an aspiration made all the more important by today’s cacophony of voices and opinions.\\xa0', 'Our assessments aren’t always popular, or what our policy makers had hoped to hear, but these clear-eyed assessments are necessary – as Tocqueville might have put it – to help “educate democracy.”', 'And they are necessary to help the US and our allies navigate what is the most complex, volatile, and challenging threat environment since World War II.\\xa0', 'Among these threats, we are particularly concerned by external actors working to exacerbate existing social divides in our countries and undermine our democratic order.\\xa0', 'Some—particularly Russia—have pursued and will pursue even more aggressive cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns with the intent of degrading our democratic values and weakening our alliances.\\xa0', 'While I’m on the topic of Russian malign activity, I’d like to take a second to speak some truth with regards to Russia’s behavior.\\xa0\\xa0', 'And by behavior, I mean their actions…. not their words.\\xa0\\xa0', 'In 2016, Russia conducted an unprecedented influence campaign to interfere in the US electoral and political process.', 'It is 2018, and we continue to see Russian targeting of American society in ways that could affect our midterm elections.', 'Last year, in France, Russian actors conducted hack and release campaigns against President Macron during the French elections.', 'Last year, Russia conducted similar operations against German and Norwegian political candidates in an effort to undermine politicians critical of Russia.\\xa0', 'Last year, Russian actors attempted to exploit divisions in Spain over Catalonia in an effort to weaken the Spanish government.', 'Last year, the Russian military attacked Ukraine with a disruptive cyber-attack… that affected thousands of computer users and cost billions of dollars in damages worldwide. It was the most damaging cyber attack to date.', 'And, just three months ago, Russian agents attempted to kill two people in the UK using a nerve agent – endangering the lives of hundreds of innocent people nearby, including children.', 'Vladimir Putin says he wants a united and prosperous Europe because it is Russia’s biggest trade and economic partner, yet all one needs to do is look at the actions of the Russian state, not Putin’s pronouncements.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0', 'Invading Ukraine, seizing Crimea, attacking individuals in the UK with nerve agent, conducting cyber-attacks against multiple EU countries, and undermining the energy resources of Eastern European countries do not strike me as unifying actions.\\xa0\\xa0', 'I could go on… but I think my point is obvious.', 'These Russian actions are purposeful and premeditated and they represent an all-out assault, by Vladimir Putin, on the rule of law, Western ideals and democratic norms.', 'His actions demonstrate that he seeks to sow divisions within and between those in the West who adhere to democratic norms.\\xa0\\xa0', 'This should not be a surprise.\\xa0 President Putin openly acknowledges that his experience in the KGB has established his approach to politics.\\xa0', 'Perhaps that is why he thrives in an environment of cynicism, lies, and misdirection.\\xa0\\xa0', 'He arrests those who dare to run against him in elections and then celebrates when he receives 76% of the popular vote.', 'The facts and international law are clear and hard to refute.\\xa0 Which is why the Kremlin resorts to accusations of “Russophobia” and lies when we hold the Russian government accountable for their actions.\\xa0', 'These accusations hold no weight and reflect the old legal saying, “When the facts are your side, pound the facts. When the law is on your side, pound the law.\\xa0 When neither the facts nor the law is on your side, pound the table.”\\xa0', 'In the face of this common threat, our history of relationships with our democratic allies in Europe bears particular importance.\\xa0', 'Our ties are longstanding and durable.\\xa0', 'They are forged over time and distance, through common purpose and shared sacrifice.\\xa0', 'And our ability to share information, knowledge, and insights about common threats is a foundational pillar of our collective intelligence capabilities, and it would be naïve to think that these threats will dissipate.\\xa0', 'And so our cooperation against these threats is a challenge that together we must engage in.', 'Of course, our relationships will inevitably ebb and flow.\\xa0', 'We will have differences over policies. We always have, but our overarching relationships have endured.', 'I arrived in Germany in September of 2001 and my 2nd\\xa0day on the job as the U.S. Ambassador was September 11th, 2001.', 'In the days and months that followed that fateful day we developed a remarkable partnership with the Germans in our joint efforts against terrorism.\\xa0', 'During that same time period though, the U.S. relationship with France soured to the point that US Embassies in Europe received guidance from Washington that we were to stop serving French wine.\\xa0', 'This wasn’t a big problem for our Embassy in Berlin – our wine cellar was stocked with German and American wine.\\xa0', 'But I called our then Ambassador in France – Howard Leach – to see how they were faring with this State Department requirement.\\xa0', 'He reported they too had received the instructions from Washington.', 'He assured me that they were honoring the guidance to get rid of their stock of French wine…one bottle at a time.\\xa0', 'Almost twenty years later, those differences are memories of the past.\\xa0', 'And we now see the center of gravity in Europe shifting toward France.\\xa0', 'President Macron is clearly taking a more assertive role in addressing European and global challenges.\\xa0', 'And our intelligence cooperation with the French is quite strong and hopefully will continue to grow.\\xa0\\xa0', 'One of the benefits of this trip is the opportunity I have to visit with and strengthen ties to my intelligence and security counterparts here in France.\\xa0\\xa0', 'Meanwhile, as a former Ambassador to Germany, I’m personally disappointed to see that Germany – the country most capable of providing strength and resources to Europe – isn’t punching up to its weight.\\xa0', 'Our expectation is that our partners will join us in countering malign aggression and global threats.\\xa0', 'In doing so, they are not taking a political stand, but a stand to guard and sustain our security and democratic values.\\xa0', 'True cooperation requires that we all contribute our fair share of our unique expertise, capabilities, and resources because the threats we are facing are simply too complex to tackle alone.\\xa0', 'Recognizing that the United States cannot be the sole global security guarantor.', 'On this point it should be noted that we have appreciated President Macron’s willingness to take a greater role in global and regional security issues.', 'Cooperation also requires that we see beyond the ebb and flow of policy disputes, and maintain our steady collaboration on vital security interests.\\xa0', 'In this sense, we must support European institutions, like NATO, that are both the target and deterrent to malign aggression.\\xa0', 'I’ve been an enthusiastic supporter of the new NATO intelligence division under the leadership of my German friend Arndt Freitag von Loringhoven. \\xa0', 'This newly established intelligence arm of NATO creates a mechanism to coordinate and integrate intelligence among member states.', 'This is similar to the approach we have taken in the United States to integrate the 17 elements our Intelligence Community.\\xa0', 'In doing so, we bring to life Aristotle’s dictum that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.\\xa0', 'The Russian threat in particular has awakened Europe to the need to reinvigorate NATO and bolster our collective defenses.\\xa0', 'Allow me to repeat this again…', 'The Russians are actively seeking to divide our Alliance, and we must not allow that to happen.\\xa0', 'And so I call on all of our allies to carry their share of the burden and shared responsibility we have to address the challenge of our time.\\xa0', 'As I conclude, let me acknowledge that I know that governing a democracy is complex and difficult.\\xa0', 'After all, I served in the U.S. Congress for most of my career with a front row seat to the difficulty of legislating in a toxic public environment.\\xa0\\xa0', 'But I urge us all to look beyond the day-to-day headlines, individual policy differences, and the fractious politics in our countries.', 'And remain focused on the long-term trajectory of the threats we face and the cooperation we need to address those threats.\\xa0', 'Seventy-four years ago, our forefathers fought, bled, and sacrificed their lives to free a continent from fascism.\\xa0', 'Today, we honor that sacrifice by recommitting ourselves to the democratic values that Tocqueville articulated.\\xa0', 'Standing together in defense of the democratic order should be and must be our number one priority.\\xa0\\xa0', 'We owe this to our forefathers, to those who lie below the thousands of white marble crosses in military cemeteries in Europe, America, and around the world, and to our public today, and finally to all those that will inherit the foundational values of democracy, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\\xa0', 'Thank you.', 'The

By your service you made clear your choice about what kind of world we want for our children: The world of violent jihadist terrorists, or one defined by Abraham Lincoln when he advised us to listen to our better angels?', 'I searched for words to pay my respects to all of you here tonight and had to turn to others more articulate than I to convey what our service meant. Someone once said that America is like a bank: If you want to take something out, then you must be willing to put something in.', 'For the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars—poorly explained and inconclusive wars, the first major wars since our Revolution fought without a draft forcing some men into the ranks—the question of what our service meant may loom large in your minds. You without doubt have put something into the nation’s moral bank.', 'Rest assured that by your service, you sent a necessary message to the world and especially to those maniacs who thought by hurting us that they could scare us.', 'No granite monuments, regardless of how grandly built, can take the place of your raw example of courage, when in your youth you answered your country’s call. When you looked past the hot political rhetoric. When you voluntarily left behind life’s well-lit avenues. When you signed that blank check to the American people payable with your lives. And, most important, when you made a full personal commitment even while, for over a dozen years, the country’s political leadership had difficulty defining our national level of commitment.', 'You built your own monument with a soldier’s faith, embracing an unlimited liability clause and showing America’s younger generation at its best when times were at their worst.', 'Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., arguably the most articulate justice in the Supreme Court’s history and himself a combat-experienced infantry officer in our awful Civil War, said: “As life is action and passion, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived.”', 'You, my fine veterans, are privileged that you will never face a judgment of having failed to live fully. For you young patriots were more concerned in living life fully than in your own longevity, freely facing daunting odds and the random nature of death and wounds on the battlefield.', 'So long as you maintain that same commitment to others and that same enthusiasm for life’s challenges that you felt in yourself, your shipmates, your comrades and buddies, you will never question at age 45 on a shrink’s couch whether you have lived.', 'Veterans know the difference between being in a dangerous combat zone and being in close combat, seeking out and killing the enemy. Close combat is tough. Much of the rest of war is boring if hard work. Yet nothing is mentally crippling about hard work in dangerous circumstances, as shown by generations of American veterans who came thankfully home as better men and women.', 'Close combat, however, is an “incommunicable experience”—again quoting Holmes. Then there was Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the Union general, who spoke of war’s effects, distinguishing the impact of close combat from military service in general. He said that such combat is “a test of character, it makes bad men worse and good men better.”', 'We are masters of our character, choosing what we will stand for in this life. Veterans today have had a unique privilege, that of having seen the tenacious spirit of our lads, like those young grunts preparing for a patrol by loosely wrapping tourniquets on their limbs so they could swiftly stop their own bleeding if their legs were blown off. Yet day after day they stoically patrolled. Adversity, we are told, reveals a man to himself, and young patriots coming home from such patrols are worth more than gold, for nothing they face can ever again be that tough.', 'Now, most of us lost friends, the best of friends, and we learned that war’s glory lay only in them—there is no other glory in warfare. They were friends who proved their manhood at age 18, before they could legally drink a beer. They were young men and women taking responsibility for their own actions, never playing the victim card. Rather, they took responsibility for their own reaction to adversity.', 'This was something that we once took for granted in ourselves and in our buddies, units where teenagers naturally stood tall, and we counted on each other. Yet it is a characteristic that can seem oddly vacant in our post-military society, where victimhood often seems to be celebrated. We found in the ranks that we were all coequal, general or private, admiral or seaman. We were equally committed to the mission and to one another, a thought captured by Gen. Robert E. Lee, saying his spirit bled each time one of his men fell.', 'Looking back over my own service, I realize now how fortunate I was to experience all this and the many riotous excursions I had when I was privileged to march or fight beside you. And a question comes to mind: What can I do to repay our country for the privilege of learning things that only you in this room could have taught me? For today I feel sorry for those who were not there with us when trouble loomed. I sometimes wonder how to embrace those who were not with us, those who were not so fortunate to discover what we were privileged to learn when we were receiving our Masters and Ph.D.s in how to live life, and gaining the understanding and appreciation of small things that we would otherwise have never known.', 'How do we embrace our fellow citizens who weren’t there? America is too large at heart for divisions between us. If we became keenly aware of anything at war, it was what is printed on our coins: “E Pluribus Unum”—out of many, one.', 'We veterans did our patriotic duty, nothing more, certainly nothing less, and we need to “come home” like veterans of all America’s wars. Come home stronger and more compassionate, not characterized as damaged, or with disorders, or with syndromes or other disease labels. Not labeled dependent on the government even as we take the lead in care of our grievously wounded comrades and hold our Gold Star families close. We deserve nothing more than a level playing field in America, for we endured nothing more, and often less, than vets of past wars.', 'For whatever trauma came with service in tough circumstances, we should take what we learned—take our post-traumatic growth—and, like past generations coming home, bring our sharpened strengths to bear, bring our attitude of gratitude to bear. And, most important, we should deny cynicism a role in our view of the world.', 'We know that in tough times cynicism is just another way to give up, and in the military we consider cynicism or giving up simply as forms of cowardice. No matter how bad any situation, cynicism has no positive impact. Watching the news, you might notice that cynicism and victimhood often seem to go hand-in-hand, but not for veterans. People who have faced no harsh trials seem to fall into that mode, unaware of what it indicates when taking refuge from responsibility for their actions. This is an area where your example can help our society rediscover its courage and its optimism.', 'We also learned the pleasure of exceeding expectations. We saw the power we brought when working together as a team. We learned alongside one another, in teams where admired leadership built teamwork, where free men and women could change the world.', 'Now having seen the moon shine on the other side of the world and having worked with others of many cultures, having worked in one of the most diverse teams on earth—that of the U.S. military—and having faced down grim circumstances without losing our sense of humor or moral balance under conditions where war’s realities scrape away civilization’s veneer, we have learned that nothing can stop our spirit unless we ignore Lincoln’s call to our better angels.', 'American colleges and businesses know your pedigree for commitment, reliability and loyalty. This is why so many corporations and startups aggressively recruit veterans. As San Francisco-based Uber sums it up: Veterans deliver higher value. Bellwether companies like Microsoft, Uber, Starbucks and more act on that premise.', 'I will close with words again borrowed from others.', 'From Alexander Dumas: You should be satisfied with the way you have conducted yourselves, “with no remorse for the past, confident regarding the present and full of hope for the future.” When you retire to bed you should sleep “the sleep of the brave.”', 'If Jackie Robinson, a sparkling ballplayer and veteran of World War II, could write his own epitaph on leadership by saying “A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives,” then you who are fortunate to have learned so much living in the greatest country on earth while making an impact so young—you should recognize that our country needs your vigor and wisdom. It was gained at great cost to our comrades and to our Gold Star families, who need to see their sons’ spirits live on in your enthusiasm for life.', 'I am reminded of Gen.

Closer to home, and through the “U.S. - Colombia Action Plan on Regional Security,”', 'Colombia provides vital assistance to its Central American, Caribbean and Mexican neighbors in', 'the fight against criminal networks. They are vitally important in this endeavor because the U.S.', 'military given all of the demands in other more violent or potentially more violent reaches of the', 'world, is unavailable for this critical duty in the Western Hemisphere. And I want to note here', 'that every aspect of U.S. collaboration under this Plan, including activities conducted by', 'Southern Command, is facilitated through U.S. security assistance and governed by the same', 'U.S. laws and regulations—especially those requiring the human rights vetting of units—', 'regulating the activities of our own military personnel. Colombia is also the example to every', 'other nation in the region that stares into the bottomless abyss of failed statehood. Colombia', 'once stared into this same darkness, an abyss due largely to the activities of the region’s “narco-', 'terrorist” organizations responding to the demand for drugs in the United States, but they', 'changed everything and won. They changed their laws, their tax code, their business', 'environment, their approach to counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations, their', 'approach to democracy and human rights—and they won.', 'The vast majority of the tonnage of all four of these drugs—heroin, meth, cocaine, and', 'pharmaceuticals—are then trafficked by the Trans-National Criminal Organizations via the', 'Central American - Mexican criminal network(s) directly into the U.S. This network-of-', '________________', 'networks, by the way, is generally controlled by the Mexican cartels with many subcontractors', 'interspersed throughout the region and the world for that matter. The enterprise begins in the', 'jungles of Colombia, runs along the Central American transit vector, into Mexico. Once in', 'Mexico so effective are the cartels in taking advantage of the laws, corruption and intimidation,', 'of that country and our own, their illicit cargo—drugs, people or anything else that can pay to', 'ride the network—can already be considered to be in Madison, Wilmington, Phoenix, Columbus,', 'Billings, Cheyenne, Boston, and Manchester. The distribution networks reach deep inside every', 'U.S. city, small town, rural community and neighborhood. The men and women involved in this', 'enterprise are among the most cruel and violent on the planet, are unencumbered by morals, laws', 'or regulations, other than to maximize profits. They do not check passports, inspect bags,', 'conduct body scans, or test for explosive residue. Anything and anybody can travel on this', 'network so long as the price can be met, and, frankly, the fare is very reasonable considering.', 'As an aside, Peru with whom we have very good relations in the military, law', 'enforcement and political realms, and Bolivia who we do not, are the first and second largest', 'producers of cocaine in the world—which is the big profit maker. The production from these', 'two nations feed the world market carried by equally efficient and violent networks that flow', 'west across the Pacific, and east through Brazil and increasingly through Paraguay, Uruguay and', 'Argentina to Africa, Europe and the Middle East. And with trafficking eventually comes', 'consumption. For example, the U.S. is the #1 consumer of cocaine in the world. Brazil, until a', 'few years ago was not a consumer nation at all, but once the network was established it is only a', 'matter of time until the cartels and network “managers” develop a market until today with Brazil', 'achieving the dubious status of being the #2 consumer in the world. The Paraguayans, the', 'Argentines, indeed any transit country will quickly experience the same phenomenon.', '________________', 'Members of the Committee, much like Colombia was able to accomplish over the last 15', 'years our friends across the region are committed to winning back their streets, indeed their', 'countries, from criminal gangs and drug traffickers, and doing so while protecting human rights.', 'The Hondurans, Guatemalans, El Salvadorans, Jamaicans, Dominicans, they are all ready and', 'willing to partner with the United States. They are eager for expanded cooperation and increased', 'learning and training opportunities with the U.S. military and law enforcement. But they are', 'very frustrated by what they perceive as the low prioritization of Latin America and the', 'Caribbean on our national security and foreign policy agendas, which is especially puzzling', 'given the shared challenges of transnational organized crime and narco-terrorism. They are also', 'frustrated in the current approach the U.S. is taking towards drugs as we move forward towards', 'outright legalization or de facto legalization by expanding the “medical” use of drugs like', 'marijuana. They also cringe when Americans in any capacity or role make the case that', '“recreational” use of drugs is “harmless,” or that the vast majority of drug dealing on our streets', 'is non-violent. All this, while we continue to encourage and often times criticize our friends to', 'the south for not doing what we think is enough to reduce production, or impede the transport of', 'these killer substances though their national territories to the U.S.', 'In the world in which they live—the Mexicans, Central Americans, Colombians,', 'Peruvians, and across the Caribbean including Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands—in their world', 'there is no such thing as a “non-violent” drug deal as thousands die annually in their countries as', 'a result of the business of supplying drugs to the American market. Good, decent and honest', 'police officers and soldiers, judges and prosecutors, legislators and journalists, officials from the', 'various ministries—and their wives, children, mothers and fathers, their entire families—are', 'intimidated, corrupted or killed so that Americans can get high on weekends or spend their time', '________________', '“Chasing the Dragon” of addiction. The word “hypocrisy” often times comes up when one', 'speaks with our friends to the south because we do little, certainly in their view, to reduce the', 'demand.', 'If it is not obvious as this point, I will cut to the bottom line and tell you that the', 'fundamental factor that drives the entire illicit enterprise is our country’s demand for heroin,', 'methamphetamines, cocaine, and opiates in pill form. I do not even include marijuana and the', 'many synthetic offshoots which in and of itself is a major factor in so many social ills. It is in', 'fact a “gateway drug” to more destructive illegal drug use, and its use results in a great many', 'destructive physical effects on the brain, the user’s health, and social development. Many', 'hoping to cash in on the emerging commercial enterprise that is legal or medical marijuana work', 'hard to discount or deny these facts, but they are facts. It is at the same time ludicrous and', 'inconceivable to me why with all the Americas already struggling with drug and alcohol', 'addiction that we would make available even more substances to poison the body and confuse', 'the brain. To make the powerful modern-day drug that is marijuana available on demand and', 'compound the problem.', 'Mr. Chairman, it is a fool’s position to think that the tax revenue raised by legal sales will', 'offset the physical and social costs of its use. Indications and warnings are already coming in', 'from those states that have legalized the drug or allowed widespread “medical” use and abuse,', 'but something to consider is what the DEA would tell you and that is for every dollar raised from', 'two drugs already legal—tobacco and alcohol—amounts approaching 23 and 17 dollars', 'respectively are paid out by the already overburdened taxpayer to deal with the effects of these', 'two drugs. If those public officials voting to legalize pot either by outright legalization, or via', 'the dispensing of medical marijuana, were responsible they would most certainly, and', '________________', 'responsibly, consider the additional burden that it will have on the tax payer and add additional', 'tax by say 17x onto the price of the drug at the counter.', 'Our drug demand, including marijuana, to a large degree has wrought devastating', 'consequences in many of our partner nations, degrading their civilian police and justice systems,', 'corrupting their institutions, and contributing to a breakdown in citizen safety. The tentacles of', 'global networks involved in narcotics and arms trafficking, human smuggling (including the', '18,000 young women and boys the UN tells us are smuggled into the U.S. every year to serve as', 'sex slaves) , illicit finance, and other types of illegal activity reach across Latin America and the', 'Caribbean and into the United States, yet we continue to almost ignore the threat TCOs present', 'to our homeland and the significant and direct risk to our national security and that of our partner', 'nations. Unless confronted by an immediate, visible, or uncomfortable crisis, our nation’s', 'tendency is to take these threats that ride the networks into and through the Western Hemisphere', 'for granted or hope for the best. I believe this is a huge mistake. I believe hope was and is the', 'same approach the Europeans in general, and the French and Belgians specifically, took', 'regarding their borders—and they lost.', 'In 2014 estimates there were nearly half a million migrants from Central America and', 'Mexico—including over 50,000 unaccompanied children (UAC) and families—were', 'apprehended on our border, many fleeing violence, poverty, and the spreading influence of', 'criminal networks and gangs. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson testified that the', '“UAC migration serves as a warning sign that the serious and longstanding challenges in Central', '________________', 'America are worsening.” In my opinion, the relative ease with which human smugglers moved', 'tens of thousands of people along the networks also serves as another warning sign: these', 'smuggling routes are a potential vulnerability to our homeland. As I stated many times in open', 'hearings to the House and Senate defense committees, terrorist organizations could easily', 'leverage those same smuggling routes to move operatives or materiel with intent to cause grave', 'harm to our citizens. Mr. Chairman, Members, addressing the root causes of insecurity and', 'instability is not just in the region’s interests, but ours as well. This is why responsible public', 'officials never surrender in the effort to highlight the threat and support the Congress’ and', 'administration’s commitment to increase assistance to Central America, Colombia and other', 'partners in the region—help which should be viewed as an investment and not foreign aid.', 'These and other challenges underscore the enduring importance of protecting the', 'southern approaches to the U.S., and this cannot—should not—be attempted as an endless series', 'of “goal-line stands” on the one-foot line at the official ports-of-entry or along the thousands of', 'miles of border between this country and Mexico. The men and women of the Department of', 'Homeland Security and local law enforcement that work that border are highly skilled and', 'incredibly dedicated, but overwhelmed. They are overwhelmed by the efficiency of the network', 'and the funding the cartels have to guarantee their illicit products and people will get through.', 'The effort to get at our drug demand begins, or should begin, on the cartel’s end of the field and', 'with a much greater effort. The U.S. military is almost absent in the effort due to an almost total', 'lack of naval forces, although the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Paul Zukunft', 'USCG, seeing the dire need immediately upon assuming his current duties increased the number', '________________', 'of cutters and personnel committed to the effort. The Coast Guard’s cupboard is nearly bare,', 'however, given all the commitments the men and women of that organization are required to', 'address in the waters surrounding the United States with an insufficient number of National', 'Security Cutters and other vessels to do what they need to do globally. Our Coast Guard has', 'more demands on it than it can address, but try they do and they are amazing.', 'The incredibly strong partnerships I enjoyed as the SOUTHCOM commander with the', 'U.S. interagency—especially with the Department of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard,', 'DEA, FBI, ATF, the intelligence community and the Departments of Treasury and State all fused', 'together by the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force-South (JIATF South) in Key West —were and are', 'fundamental to the efforts to try and safeguard the southern defense of the U.S. homeland from.', 'If you want a report card on how effectively the interagency is accomplishing the mission, how', 'the effort to prevent malign cargo and illegal migrants from entering the country is going, I will', 'let you draw your own conclusions. I will say, however, that even though we are so incredibly', 'fortunate to have willing partners like Colombia, Chile, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala,', 'Honduras, and Panama, and remarkable interagency cooperation, it’s the demand...it’s always', 'about the demand.', 'Domestic Impact', 'Americans have been consuming hard drugs in immense quantities certainly since the', 'mid-1960s when the use of drugs became literally cool as projected by Hollywood, social', '“progressives,” and even Harvard professors. Since then it has ebbed and flowed—although', 'mostly flowed—over the years, but regardless of what the immediate use trends were along the', 'timeline it has always been a constant in the inner city and working class neighborhoods of our', 'cities. The epidemic we talk about and are so rightly concerned with today is due in very large', '________________', 'measure because the addiction, and the associated violent crime and deaths due to overdose, are', 'no longer a problem of our minority and working class neighborhoods. The death and crime has', 'exploded into the suburbs. The body count is now conducted on Capitol Hill and in Georgetown,', 'on Beacon Hill and the ivy league and Stanford campuses, and not just in the urban areas of our', 'great cities.', 'Until the last few years the number of our citizens dying from the use of hard drugs', 'trafficked into the United States from abroad by narco-terrorist transnational criminal syndicates,', 'or acquired through illegal prescriptions, hovered around 40,000 annually. To put it another way', 'since 9/11 when 3,000 were killed by another form of terrorism, over 560,000 have been in my', 'view murdered by narco-terrorists. In the past few years even the outrageous number of 40,000', 'began to spike until last year the number went beyond 46,000. The DEA tells us that in 2013', 'there were 8,620 heroin deaths due to overdose. These deaths are increasing everyday across the', 'land but particularly in states in the Middle Atlantic, New England and the Midwest. In fact the', 'Center for Disease Control puts the number at 44 a day or over 16,000 a year. To put a more', 'focused face on this growing tragedy, in 2014 the New Hampshire Office of the Chief Medical', 'Examiner predicted more than 400 deaths from heroin overdoses in 2015 which would have been', 'more than double the amount that small state of only 1.3 million experienced in 2013. He was', 'wrong. It was higher. Senator Ayotte among others in this body has been a champion of raising', 'the awareness of the issue not only in her own state, but nationally, but in my view it has in many', 'ways fallen on deaf ears as solving this problem will be hard, really hard, maybe too hard—but I', 'think it is worth trying.', 'Other impacts on our society are obvious even to the numb. Law enforcement figures tell', 'us that a very-large percentage of individuals arrested for major crimes—including homicide,', '________________', 'theft and assault—are under the influence of illicit drugs. The same sources tell us that 93% of', 'those abusers believe they do not need help even while they are committing violent crimes or', 'selling their bodies to feed their habits, in and out of rehab, or saved multiple times when they', 'are found in the gutters and “crack houses” by police officers and first responders. Most of these', 'abusers started with the gateway drug that marijuana most certainly is, and even while abusing', 'heroin are also routinely using at least one other drug. And the dollar cost is immense with the', 'estimate at over $200B to deal with drug abuse; much of it on rehabilitation that most agree is at', 'best marginally effective even over the short term.', 'Security Environment', 'As stated in the introduction the end results of decades of rampant demand for drugs in', 'the U.S.—and even if we do not care what it is doing to our own society—has caused the spread', 'of criminal organizations that continue to tear at the social, economic, and security fabric of our', 'Mexican, Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Powerful and well-resourced, these TCOs', 'traffic in drugs—including cocaine, heroin, marijuana, counterfeit pharmaceuticals, and', 'methamphetamine—but have evolved grown in size and sophistication. They have also', 'broadened the services and products they provide. The cartels and networks now largely control', 'the sale and movement of small arms and explosives, precursor chemicals for use in producing', 'industrial quantities of heroin and meth, illegally mined gold which is unbelievably destructive to', 'fragile environments, counterfeit goods, people, and other contraband. They engage in pervasive', 'money laundering, bribery, intimidation, and assassinations at every level of society from the cop', 'on the street to the president of a country. They threaten the very underpinnings of democracy', 'itself: citizen safety, rule of law, and economic prosperity. They have turned particularly Central', 'America and Mexico into among the most dangerous nations on earth by UN numbers of deaths', '________________', 'per 100,000 citizens. They have had the very same impact on our own Puerto Rico and the', 'Americans who reside there. And these criminal cartels pose a direct threat to the stability of our', 'partners and an insidious risk to the security of our nation. If these groups were motivated', 'politically to destroy these countries and bring down these governments by violence we would', 'label them insurgents and lend appropriate support, as we have in Colombia and Peru, to help', 'them fight the narco-terrorist organizations that are The Shining Path and FARC. But because', 'they are motivated by crime and profit, and not aggressive politics or extremist ideology, and', 'despite the fact that are directly and indirectly killing 40,000+ of our citizens every year, many in', 'our government hide make the case that this is law enforcement as opposed to a military', 'problem. I can assure you it is both and the partner nations at risk have no choice but to re-train', 'their military units for internal police duties.', 'While there is growing recognition of the danger posed by transnational organized crime,', 'it is often eclipsed by other concerns. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I believe we are overlooking a', 'significant security threat. Despite the very effective efforts of the men and women of law', 'enforcement, TCOs are constantly adapting their methods for trafficking anything and', 'everything, and anybody, across our border. While there is not yet any indication that the', 'criminal networks involved in human and drug trafficking are interested in supporting the efforts', 'of terrorist groups, these networks could unwittingly right now facilitate the movement of', 'terrorist operatives or weapons of mass destruction toward our borders, potentially undetected', 'and almost completely unrestricted. In addition to thousands of Central Americans fleeing', 'poverty and violence, foreign nationals from countries like Somalia, Bangladesh, Lebanon, and', '________________', 'Pakistan are using the region’s human smuggling networks to enter the United States.3 While', 'many are merely seeking economic opportunity or fleeing a “narco-insurgency” that we have', 'largely created, a subset could potentially be seeking to do us grave harm. Thankfully, we have', 'not observed any hard evidence of this occurring...yet. That said, however, as was the case in', 'Boston, or San Bernardino, or Paris or Brussels—and despite the best efforts of our overworked', 'and underappreciated intelligence professionals most notably the CIA, DIA and NSA, and our', 'embattled law enforcement including the FBI, ATF, CBP and Border Patrol, and the uniformed', 'officers on the street—we often learn that the terrorists are here only when the bomb goes off', 'and the body count has begun. I am deeply concerned, and you should be deeply concerned as', 'our elected leaders, that smuggling networks are a vulnerability that terrorists could seek to', 'exploit. I do not see it as a maybe, but as a when.', 'You should also be troubled by the financial and operational overlap between criminal', 'and terrorist networks in the region. Although the extent of criminal-terrorist cooperation is', 'unclear, what is clear is that terrorists and militant organizations easily tap into the international', 'illicit marketplace to underwrite their activities and obtain arms and funding to conduct', 'operations.', 'It’s easy to see why: illicit trafficking is estimated to be a $650 billion industry', 'worldwide—larger than the GDP of all but 20 countries in the world—and less than one percent', 'of global illicit financial flows is seized or frozen.', 'It is estimated that the profits from cocaine', 'sales alone in the U.S. go beyond $80B. Indeed, the biggest problem the narco-terrorists have is', 'not getting drugs into the U.S., but laundering the immense profits from the enterprise. The', '________________', 'terrorist group Lebanese Hezbollah—which has long viewed the region as a potential attack', 'venue against Israeli or other Western targets—has supporters and sympathizers in Lebanese', 'diaspora communities in Latin America, some of whom are involved in lucrative illicit activities', 'like money laundering and trafficking in counterfeit goods and drugs. These clan-based criminal', 'networks exploit corruption and lax law enforcement in places like the Tri-Border Area of', 'Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina and the Colon Free Trade Zone in Panama and generate', 'revenue, an unknown amount of which is transferred to Lebanese Hezbollah. Unfortunately, our', 'limited intelligence capabilities focused on this accumulation of funding make it difficult to fully', 'assess the amount of terrorist financing generated in Latin America, or understand the scope of', 'possible criminal-terrorist collaboration in this region of immense-illicit funding.', 'Demand Reduction', 'As a nation we cannot interdict, or shoot, or convict, or rehabilitate our way out of this', 'hell. It will take all of these approaches and more to solve the problem and significantly reduce', 'drug abuse. If U.S. drug demand is a large part of the problem, then reducing that demand is', 'essential to getting our arms not only around the problems in our own country, but also the', 'problem our demand cause our partner nations and the support it gives to terrorism. Demand', 'reduction is to say the least a multi–faceted challenge. It begins in the coca or poppy fields', 'hundreds of miles south of our border with Colombian soldiers killed by IEDs, and the families', 'of Mexican Marines murdered in retaliation for their efforts in our drug fight. It ends in the U.S.', 'in a rehab clinic somewhere inside our country.', 'But we know how to do this. We know how to design a campaign to save lives and', 'significantly reduce a social cancer. When I was in grade school the Center for Disease Control', '________________', 'informs us that roughly 70% percent of Americans smoked cigarettes. A pack was maybe .30', 'cents. At nine or ten years old I would routinely walk down to the corner store and buy a pack of', 'Chesterfields for my mother or Camels for my father. Lung cancer was off the chart. Today the', 'CDC estimates that less than 20% of Americans smoke. This unbelievable behavior', 'modification was accomplished first and foremost by an effective and never ending campaign to', 'make Americans wake up to what smoking does to the body, then by raising the price per pack', 'so that it is out of the reach of most intelligent Americans, insurance premiums went up if you', 'smoked, the legal age to purchase was fixed at 18 and is now going to 21 in many states, and by', 'severely limiting where one can light up and essentially making smokers outcasts. It worked.', 'We also did it to battle and significantly reduce drinking-and-driving saving hundreds of', 'thousands of lives and significantly reducing serious injury due to automobile accidents. The', 'very same applies to seat belt use. Forty 40 years ago no one “buckled up,” today only the most', 'irresponsible among us would even start an automobile without first fastening their kids in, then', 'themselves. The same applies to car seats for infants and small children, helmets for young', 'bikers, and even to reducing littering along our streets and highways. The success of these', 'campaigns was not only law enforcement, although law enforcements and penalties were without', 'question part of the solution. As in the case of auto deaths and injury, the success came as a', 'result of a comprehensive and an unrelenting campaign of educating our citizens across every', 'age group focusing on children and young adults in school, new drivers and their parents, and the', 'older generations who until the campaigns were unleashed in the early 1980s just assumed that', 'the carnage our society was experiencing on the highways was simply the price required of a', 'motorized society. But it wasn’t.', '________________', 'Hollywood got behind the effort, as did responsible politicians and civic officials. No', 'elected official in his or her right mind opposed it even with intense lobbying efforts by Detroit', 'first against installing seat belts then over mandatory air bags, and certainly did not try to', 'rationalize the problem away and raise tax revenue from it. Everyone got on board—and it', 'worked. Anyone under the age of say 40 today simply cannot imagine a time when we did', 'things differently, when we did not have seat belts and air bags, but there was a time we did. As', 'with the campaign today to raise awareness of climate change—whether one agrees of disagrees', 'with the cause and effect claims—all are at least fully aware of the issue. Even those who reject', 'the science have reduced their energy consumption and know it is good for the environment. We', 'know how to do this, and it is the only way to not only reduce the cost and misery to our own', 'people, but also to the nations to our south who suffer so from our demand. We will never get to', 'zero, but perhaps we can reduce the abuse of drugs by over 50% as we did with nicotine, and', 'save tens-of-thousands of our citizens as we did when we protected them in their automobiles.', 'And just as importantly reduce the profits available to the criminal and terrorist networks.', 'I will close with a few final thoughts. The first is that we must keep the pressure on the', 'cartels and destroy their crops before they are harvested, destroy their production facilities', 'wherever they are, and break up the networks by arrest and prosecution. We must also combine', 'these often times kinetic efforts with locating the financial institutions that knowingly or', 'unknowingly support the financial aspect of drug trafficking—and seize their billions. Second, I', 'want to highlight the efforts of my very good friend Mike Botticelli, the Director of National', 'Drug Control Policy, who quite rightly tells us that with addiction we are really dealing with a', 'disease and we should be focused on saving and rehabilitating those unfortunate to suffer the', 'disease, and not just jailing them even for petty crimes. At the same time we must understand', '________________', 'that the overwhelming number of men and women involved in the production, transport, and', 'distribution of these drugs are in it for the money and must be hunted down. We must also', 'acknowledge that regardless of the disease, if serious crimes are committed we cannot turn a', 'blind eye to the act just because the perpetrator is sick. But even while holding him or her', 'accountable, and while punishing them, we should as a society still try to them well. Thirdly, we', 'must develop a national campaign that appeals to the intelligence, or the good nature, or the love', 'of humanity, or paranoia, or social responsibility, or pocket book, or fear of persecution, or', 'whatever—it does not matter—so long as we have an effective program that significantly', 'reduces demand. There are individual efforts out there in American society but they are', 'uncoordinated and go unheralded. The Boy Scouts, the Young Marine Program, Drug Free', 'America Foundation, and dozens of other efforts in our communities but they are individual', 'points of light when what we need are floodlights.', 'Of note I want to alert the Committee to a combined effort by the Director of the FBI,', 'Jim Comey, and the DEA Administrator, Chuck Rosenberg. The effort, entitled, “Chasing the', 'Dragon,” is one that seeks to distribute a CD and study guide to 100,000 grade school, middle', 'school, and high school teachers “....to reach youth before an addiction can set in.” The CD is', 'powerful, horrifying, sad, disgusting, depressing, scary, and designed to get some of the most', 'powerful influencers in our society—teachers—onboard in an effort to ideally prevent, and if not', 'then to reduce drug use where it typically begins. Both organizations are also offering additional', 'resources, experts, speakers, anything to help reduce the demand of drugs and the human tragedy', 'it causes in the lives of millions. I would strongly encourage the Committee to bring in', 'representatives of the two premier drug fighting organizations in the world and get their', '________________', 'perspective on this critically important topic. I would also encourage all to sign onto the FBI', 'website at www.FBI.gov/ChasingtheDragon for additional details and perspective.', 'You might ask yourself, Mr. Chairman, “why is law enforcement and the U.S. military', 'not only into the business of detecting, monitoring, and interdicting the networks and', 'organizations that carry drugs and so many other illicit cargoes into the United States, but', 'increasingly into drug abuse prevention and demand reduction as well”? Many argue it is not', 'our job, although the nation could take a lesson as to how law and enforcement and the nation’s', 'Armed Forces have all but set drug free environments within the two organizations. Is it not', 'prevention and demand reduction the responsibility of our parents? Elected officials?', 'Government health care providers? But I would submit that when the kind of men and women', 'that serve in law enforcement, who see firsthand and everyday what drugs do to our children, our', 'families, our society and to the nation, when these kind of men and women see what it does and', 'that the effort to do something about it is too weak or non-existent—they act. I would agree that', 'it might not be their job, but since no one else seems to be doing it as effectively as it could be', 'done....', 'Good morning. I’m pleased to be here today, having been asked to offer an overview and diagnosis of the state of the U.S. economy.', 'If you had asked me to deliver such remarks twenty months ago, I would have said the U.S. economy was struggling. In the six and a half years between the start of the recovery in 2009:Q3 and the end of 2015, growth in real GDP averaged 2.2 percent, slowing to just 1.8 percent in 2016. Since the 2009:Q2 economic trough, labor productivity growth in the private nonfarm business sector through the end of 2016 averaged just 1.0 percent—less than half the pre-crisis postwar average of 2.3 percent and the slowest of any postwar expansion.', 'This was in part because, for the first time in postwar U.S. history, the contribution of capital deepening to labor productivity growth turned negative on a sustained basis, and was in fact, on average, negative for the entire 2010-2016 period, compared to an historical average of 1 percentage point.', 'In other words, during the post-2009 expansion, depreciation of existing capital per worker was exceeding investment. Indeed, in the six and a half years between the start of the recovery in 2009:Q3 and 2015, growth in real private nonresidential fixed investment averaged 4.8 percent, and slowed to just 0.7 percent in 2016.', 'What makes this record so shocking is that it is historically highly atypical. Not only was it slow by historical standards, it was also contrary to empirical evidence—confirmed by recent peer-reviewed research—that in the United States, deeper recessions are typically succeeded by steeper expansions, and that this correlation is in fact stronger when the contraction is accompanied by a financial crisis. Since the nineteenth century, the recent recovery was one of only three exceptions to this pattern.', 'So what was going on? Back in graduate school, one of the first topics that captured my interest was the question of how responsive demand for capital services is to the cost of capital. The empirical challenge, of course, is that changes in the cost of capital are not random. In particular, there is potential simultaneity bias from the fact that legislatures tend to lower corporate tax rates and raise investment tax incentives during periods of economic contraction, and to raise corporate taxes (and withdraw investment credits and other incentives) during periods of economic expansion. Obviously, such bias would lead economists to underestimate the responsiveness of demand for capital services to changes in the cost of capital.', 'When one properly accounts for this bias, as Alan Auerbach and I showed in one of my first peer-reviewed publications, one in fact observes much larger effects of the cost of capital on business investment than the academic literature had previously been estimating.', 'Several decades on, our inference that tax policy influences behavior seems to have stood the test of time, as a battery of peer-reviewed publications is now showing that a 1 percent decline in the cost of capital raises the demand for capital services by 1 percent. The capacity of economic research to identify the causal effects of variation in policy has also grown. The literature’s arc towards larger rather than smaller estimates of the effects of policy variables is all around us, and in the top journals. Consider, for instance, the emergence of what is called “the narrative approach” to identifying the effects of tax policy on economic activity. These methodologies harness advances in computational power and natural language processing to identify the stated motivations of the policymakers that Alan and I worried about back in the 90s.', 'While no single paper can be decisive, consider that the February 2018 online issue of the\\xa0Quarterly Journal of Economics\\xa0features an article that draws on this narrative approach to estimate the responsiveness of personal income with respect to marginal tax rates. The paper’s headline estimates were north of 1 for 1—very high by contemporary standards as well as those of the literature a couple decades ago. And this paper is not alone, but rather is just the latest in a growing list of articles exploiting the narrative approach to land in top five economics journals—Romer and Romer, Mertens and Ravn, Mertens and Montiel Olea, Cloyne, Hayo and Uhl.', 'But the identification of causal effects from econometric estimates can require assumptions about the structure and functional form of relationships between a specified set of policy variables and measures of economic activity. That is in addition to the requirement, of course, that you have the relevant data at hand in the first place—a requirement typically only satisfied in hindsight. But we value knowing now whether the policy is working as intended. The observation of the variation in forecasts before and after a policy is changed offers one way of looking at the policy’s likely effects, just as Alan and I did in our first paper. And so, as we economists wait for evaluations of the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on economic growth to percolate through the peer-review process and into academic journals, looking at changes in growth forecasts before and after the TCJA offers one way to gauge its expected effect on growth.', 'The evolution of recent forecast revisions is quite revealing, and consistent with the tax act having a large effect on growth expectations. If one looks, for example, at the Blue Chip consensus forecast for four-quarter real GDP growth in 2018 and 2019, it was roughly flat throughout most of 2017, as media coverage of the legislative prospects for the Administration’s economic agenda was generally pessimistic. Consensus forecasts through November 2017 were therefore low—2.3 to 2.4 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019.', 'Since November, however, we’ve seen steady upward revisions in private forecasts. As of last month, the Blue Chip consensus forecast is now for 2018 growth of 2.9 percent, and 2019 growth of 2.3 percent, upward revisions of 0.6 and 0.2 percentage point since the tax act was passed. Official forecasts revisions suggest an even bigger bump. In its last forecast before the tax bill was passed, the Congressional Budget Office projected growth of 2.0 and 1.5 percent in 2018 and 2019. That has now been revised up substantially—to 3.3 and 2.4 percent, respectively. In other words, the CBO now projects growth to be more than a percentage point higher, on average, over the next two years than they did a year ago. In addition, over the same timeframe, the CBO revised up its forecast of the effect of economic growth on projected corporate income tax receipts over the 2018-2027 period by $476 billion, which exceeds the CBO’s own $409 billion static score of the TCJA.', 'Ex ante, knowing only that the TCJA passed, based on my paper on corporate tax rates and the Laffer curve with Alex Brill, one could have predicted such a revenue increase. It is also consistent with what we would expect from the empirical literature. The corporate income tax base is highly responsive to changes in effective corporate tax rates for the same reason that investment is highly responsive to changes in effective corporate tax rates—it’s because capital is mobile!', 'In April, the International Monetary Fund released its April 2018 World Economic Outlook (WEO). Global growth for 2018 was revised up 0.2 percentage point from its October WEO release to 3.9 percent year-over-year. The IMF attributes roughly half of the global growth revision to changes in U.S. fiscal policy. When honing in on the United States, the IMF’s April 2018 update to its October 2017 World Economic Outlook revised up its growth forecast by 0.6 percentage point from October to 2.9 percent year-over-year. According to the IMF, one reason for this upward revision is the macroeconomic effects stemming from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December.', 'The IMF’s April upwards revision to its October global growth forecast in the wake of the passage of the TCJA follows the OECD’s own March upwards revision to its November global growth forecast. For the U.S., its 2018 outlook increased by 0.4 percentage point to 2.9 percent and its 2019 outlook increased by 0.7 percentage point to 2.8 percent. And the OECD’s March Economic Outlook cited as one of the “key factors behind the upward revision to global growth prospects in 2018 and 2019” the “tax reductions . . . announced in the last three months.”', 'I note in passing that these revisions are almost exactly what our analysis from last year implied they would be once the bill passes.', 'As for global growth, CEA’s own, very preliminary in-house analysis finds that exogenous tax changes in the world’s largest economy may have surprisingly large effects on global growth, suggesting the recent rise in growth expectations around the world is more the result of fiscal developments in the United States than the other way around. Applying the Romer & Romer exogenous tax shock series to a global vector autoregressive model indicates that a 1 percent cut in U.S. taxes as a fraction of GDP raises growth in the European Union and Rest of the World by almost 1 percent in the year immediately following, with a peak impact of over 1 percent after 2 years. While wide error bands suggest that we shouldn’t attach much weight to these point estimates, the important result is that we can reject the null hypothesis of no effect with 95 percent confidence.', 'Though the mechanisms relating exogenous U.S. tax changes to global growth remain an open and, I believe, fascinating question for our ongoing work, the magnitude of the effect strongly suggests they extend far beyond the arithmetic relationship implied by the U.S. share of global GDP. Our own intuition is that other countries often learn from U.S. success, and respond to first-moves by 25 percent of the world economy with adoption of similar policies.', 'But don’t just believe the forecasts. You can already see the effects emerging in the data. Growth of business fixed investment rose every quarter of 2017 to average 6.3 percent for the year, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, up from just 0.7 percent in 2016. In the first quarter of 2018, it jumped again, to 10.4 percent. Growth of equipment investment jumped to 11.6 percent in 2017:Q4 and 5.8 percent in 2018:Q1, thanks largely to the tax law’s allowance for full expensing of equipment investment retroactively to September 2017.', 'Business investment in structures and intellectual property has also surged—up 16.2 percent in Q1 for structures, and 13.2 percent for intellectual property. In Q1, private fixed investment as a share of GDP was in fact the highest it has been since the first quarter of 2008. Consistent with that evident trend shift, composite planned capital expenditure indices from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have been hitting record or near-record highs.', 'All of this is, ultimately, good news for American workers. The burden of corporate taxation is disproportionately born by labor, and it is born by labor through a long-run investment channel that results in fewer establishments, fewer factories and plants, less equipment, and at the end of the day less employment, fewer hours, lower productivity, and thus lower wages. So when we reduce the corporate tax burden, as we’ve just done, in the long-run we expect labor to enjoy a disproportionate share of that relief, through increased investment, a higher target capital stock, higher capital per worker, and thus higher productivity and wages. It’s therefore exciting to see in the 2018 data effects that are consistent on this point with top articles published in the\\xa0Journal of Political Economy,\\xa0American Economic Review, and\\xa0American Economic Journal\\xa0in just the past year.', 'An equally exciting challenge moving forward will be to identify the relative velocities of adjustment to a positive tax shock as we have just experienced. Consistent with Le Chatelier’s Principle, liquid capital markets may respond instantaneously by reallocating capital from mature, cash-rich firms to more dynamic, cash-constrained firms, whereas labor and physical capital market responses may be subject to longer time horizons.', 'But in any event, I would say that right now the fundamentals of the American economy are looking strong, with improved supply-side potential.', 'Thank you for your time, and for the generous invitation to speak with you all today.', '————————', 'When Ron Suskind published his book “The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O’Neill” in January 2004, he received rave reviews from many on the left. In researching that book, Suskind found the perfect source, Paul O’Neill, who had been fired from his post as Treasury Secretary. Suskind milked that source for an astonishing amount of inside dirt. The book was manna from heaven for those inclined to dislike President Bush.', 'Suskind’s latest effort,\\xa0“Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington and the Education of a President”\\xa0uses a similar algorithm to generate a glimpse of the current administration, this time relying on disgruntled insiders and former senior Obama administration officials. While the reception of Suskind has been quite different at The Washington Post, the New York Review of Books and The New York Times, Suskind is, after two such books, at least vying to become that most valuable of journalists, the fellow that everyone in any administration feels they must confide in, else their history will be written by rivals.', 'Reviews of “Confidence Men” have raised quibbles about the accuracy of his work, but a skeptic might wonder if the quibbles are not designed to neutralize the negative impact that the book might have on President Obama. When The New York Times and the New York Review of Books reviewed “Confidence Men,” assertions of inaccuracy were prominently featured. However, when the same outlets reviewed “The Price of Loyalty,” not a single factual error was cited. Apparently, some would have us believe that the supposedly fastidious journalist who damned George Bush was above reproach, while the same fellow became a propagandist when he turned to the study of President Obama. This view especially strains credulity given that Suskind himself is clearly sympathetic to Obama and hostile to Bush.', 'In the give and take with his critics, Suskind has for the most part responded effectively to the major assertions against him, even providing a tape-recorded interview to support his quotation. Accordingly, the purpose of this review will not be to weigh in on these disputes, but rather to first provide the reader with a summary of the evidence Suskind\\xa0presents, and then to discuss the lessons for economists involved in policymaking that one might draw from this inside view of the White House. The reader can decide for himself whether Suskind’s account sounds plausible.', 'For my part, having myself been an insider in three presidential campaigns, and a friend and/or associate of many of Suskind’s targets in both books, I can say that the account for the most part rings true, and that the problems economists face when affecting economic policy in Washington extend well beyond the Obama administration.', 'The book was penned at a time that was perhaps a political nadir for President Obama. The recovery was stagnant, the health care bill immensely unpopular, and even the president’s most ardent supporters were demoralized. Given that context, the question of why a president with such promise could have so disappointing a start to his presidency was on everyone’s mind. The main theme of Suskind’s book, which is quite charitable and even at times affectionate toward the president, is summarized aptly by Suskind’s quote of former North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan, who, when he heard that Obama had chosen Timothy Geithner to be Secretary of Treasury and Larry Summers to be chairman of the National Economic Council (NEC), said to Obama: “You’ve picked the wrong people. I don’t understand how you could do this. You’ve picked the wrong people.”', 'Suskind devotes the book to making this case, but on the policy substance he fails to do so in a way that would satisfy an economist. The fact is, the administration engaged in economic policymaking at a time of extreme uncertainty, and while one might easily find fault with administration policies and assert that alternatives would have been better, economic science has not advanced to the point that one can conclude with confidence that Suskind is correct that these gentlemen advocated specific policies that undermined President Obama’s (or the nation’s) success.', 'The truth that emerges from the book is not so much that specific policies ended up being bad, but rather, that the entire policy process spun out of control and became a farce. This seems accurate, and, as a glimpse of that development, the book is priceless. The case that the policymaking process failed President Obama is fairly solid. And for that, these two central figures clearly bear some share of the blame.', 'Suskind is especially brutal toward Summers. While one might normally turn away from such things, a list of a subset of his many assertions regarding Summers furthers the discussion when I later turn to broader lessons about how policy is made in Washington.', 'If you believe Suskind, Summers has evolved into a larger than life villain.', 'Suskind portrays Summers as an arrogant has-been, writing that “as he has aged, he has become less troubled by being uninformed. This is at least what his friends say.”\\xa0 He backs this assertion up with quotes from Summers’ colleagues, including this tidbit: “‘Like Rome,’ an old friend of Larry’s said, ‘he has spread himself too thin and must ever be on guard to put down even the slightest challenge or insurrection in intellectual territories which he claims but can’t hold.’”', 'In Suskind’s portrayal, Summers’ arrogance is Olympian, even though he has purportedly been too famous or busy to keep up with literature. Typical is the recollection of economist Andrew Metrick, who recalled to Suskind that Summers once explained to him, “I can win any argument. I can win arguing either side. But then I sit back and think, ‘Which side did I win more soundly and fairly?’\\xa0 That’s usually the right answer.”', 'Such a superhero would certainly be the perfect fellow to place in the office next to the president, but Summers’ colleagues were almost appallingly willing to dispute the accuracy of Summers’ self assessment. Suskind quotes current Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Alan Krueger as saying: “Larry would frame an argument as A versus B, and that would sound right unless you were someone with deep enough mastery of an area to know that position D represented the real counterpoint and the best policy position was probably C.”', 'Suskind invites us to consider Summers as an individual who exists somewhere in the continuum between Henry Higgins, the arrogant professor, and Hulk Hogan, the preening bully, and lets us know that his own assessment places him pretty close to the latter.', 'Having such a character loose in the halls of power presents many problems, but perhaps the most damaging was Summers’ rivalry with President Obama’s OMB director Peter Orszag. At one point, Suskind describes a scene where President Obama, apparently cognizant that Summers was not acting as an honest broker, invited Orszag to write a memo regarding policy options in the event of a fiscal crisis.', 'When Summers found out, he “stormed over from the White House to Orszag’s office, and his face was red with rage. It looked like he was about to burst a blood vessel… he told him that he, Peter, knew the rules, no matter what the president had said. Everything was supposed to go through NEC.”', 'It might seem like a stretch that someone who works for the president might encourage others to disregard his orders, but Orszag confirms the possibility on the record, stating, “Larry just didn’t think the president knew what he was deciding.”', 'Orszag’s access to the president appears to have been a constant distraction to Summers. When he learned that President Obama had decided to reappoint Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Summers lost it again. “Summers was outraged and petulant. He started to list demands to Rahm: A round of golf with Obama. He wanted to walk into major events, such as signature speeches or the State of the Union, with the Cabinet … And he wanted a car and driver … Orszag would lose direct access to Obama; he’d have to go through Summers.”', 'While President Obama is portrayed as loyal to Summers to the end, even presenting him with a silver putter upon his departure, Summers is described almost abusive toward Obama, complaining about the policy disorder by saying that: “We’re home alone. There’s no adult in charge. Clinton would never have made these mistakes.”', 'The problem, and Suskind presents numerous examples of this, is that managing the executive branch requires attention to countless issues. It is too much for any one individual to micromanage. In an organization that is beset by rivalries and jealousies, it is nearly impossible to effectively delegate responsibilities. The gigantic staffs available to the Cabinet secretaries become irrelevant, and policy design is left to the legislative branch, where chaos and logrolling determine the composition of bills, rather than sound economic reasoning.', 'A president is most effective, in my memory, when he forwards to Congress detailed legislation designed by his policy experts, and importunes Congress to pass it without “cherry picking.”\\xa0 It is a hard and fast rule in Washington that if you don’t hear the words “no cherry picking” at the onset of a legislative policy initiative, then you can expect cherries jubilee.', '\\xa0And cherries jubilee is what Obama got. From the stimulus to health care reform, Congress was clearly in charge, and clearly out of control.', 'Take the health care initiative as an example of the dysfunction.', 'Suskind provides information that will be interesting to historians when he reveals the extent to which Orszag was the driving force behind Obama’s decision to pursue health care reform. If the eventual view of historians is that health care bill defeated Obama, then they will blame Orszag.', 'Orszag, Suskind reveals, had some pretty good instincts. He was immersed in the literature emanating from Dartmouth identifying wasteful government health spending, and was convinced that reducing the enormous geographic variation in the costs of treatment for identical maladies could radically improve the U.S.’s fiscal condition. Getting ahead of that curve could well offset the negative budgetary impact of a generous economic stimulus.', 'When Orszag was summoned to Chicago after the election to discuss the OMB position, Suskind writes that “on the plane to Chicago, he considered an ultimatum: he would accept the job offer only if Obama could look him in the eye and say that health care reform would top year one’s domestic agenda.”\\xa0', 'Orszag got the job. Obama told him, according to Suskind, that he “wanted Orszag to assume an expanded portfolio as OMB chief, serving as the administration’s budget czar and also as the driving force behind health reform.”', 'The problem is that the OMB job is painfully tedious, and no human being, even the supernaturally energetic Orszag, could possibly manage to oversee a significant health care reform while running that office. Suskind writes that Orszag “protested to Emanuel in an email: ‘Listen, I can’t run health care, but someone needs to.’’', 'But nobody wanted the job. When the president gathered all the major players for a summit to further the process of health reform design, Geithner asked his then deputy, Alan Krueger, to fill in for him, saying, “I’ll just make a quick appearance, show everyone I was there, and then slip out. I don’t have time for this today.”', 'The process got so out of hand that “Tom Daschle teamed up with John Podesta, in essence, to run a policy process outside the White House.”\\xa0 That might have been a terrific outcome if the objective is to maximize lobbying profits for a couple of\\xa0 specific firms in Washington, but it is hard to see how it serves the American people to have the professionals employed by the government outside of the process.', 'Turning to Geithner, Suskind tries to make the case that he is part of a cabal of acolytes of Robert Rubin that corruptly intervened to protect Wall Street. The case is far from convincing. Indeed, Geithner comes out as a surprisingly attractive personality who was earnestly trying to do the right thing in a very difficult situation. In retrospect, for example, his policy instinct to rely on the stress tests looks to have proven itself. One can even see how the man himself could have earned Obama’s confidence enough that he is one of the last of the original principals still employed in this administration.', 'Most revealing was the moment when Geithner, stung by all of the many attacks coming his way, reflected upon entering a meeting with several key White House and Treasury strategists, “‘It’s a tough job; I’m doing everything I can.’\\xa0 He told them he’d just heard from his mother. ‘She said, ‘Tim, remember the summer you worked at that bar and the owner said you weren’t exactly the best bartender? Well, maybe this is like that, and this job just isn’t for you.’”\\xa0 He shook his head. ‘My own mother!’”', 'Geithner’s actions seem consistent with those of the humble but dedicated man this quote reveals, and unlike the other officials, he has not cashed in on his political influence. Indeed, the only real evidence of anything resembling a cabal is in the section on the auto bailout, where it is clear that union influence caused the Obama administration to overrule the advice of Obama’s economic team, and deliver billions and billions of taxpayer dollars to Obama’s financial backers in the auto unions.', 'Suskind spends a good deal of time fleshing out a number of important but lesser players like CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler, CEA member (and later chair) Austan Goolsbee, and CEA Chairwoman Christina Romer. That Goolsbee is a bit player is rather surprising, given his close friendship with the president, but the gentle spirited and engaging Goolsbee was, as Suskind documents, quite effectively pushed aside by rivals very early in the game. He is not the first campaign official, nor will he be the last, to see such a fate. The economist who was most responsible for getting Bill Clinton elected, for example, was his chief economic advisor for the campaign Robert Shapiro. But Shapiro also was outmaneuvered by political operatives masquerading as economists, notably Bob Reich and Ira Magaziner.', 'As for Romer, my personal experience with her story might provide a bit of insight. Early in the Obama administration, Christy Romer’s confirmation was being held up by Republicans, and a person close to her situation contacted me and asked for help on the grounds that Christy was being excluded from White House meetings by Larry Summers because she had not been confirmed. Since Christy’s academic work was nonpartisan, and even documented the effectiveness of tax reductions in stimulating the economy, the person argued, Republicans should want her in the meetings.', 'I have no way of knowing whether the story about exclusion was correct, and understand that there are often legalities surrounding such things that could provide an innocent explanation. But as a fan of Romer’s work, I reached out to key Republicans to discuss her obvious merits. She ended up being confirmed much sooner than expected, although there is no way of knowing whether my recommendation was relevant.', 'In any case, from Suskind’s reporting, it is clear that Romer felt marginalized while at CEA, and this seems consistent with my experience. One suspects that if she was excluded from activities before confirmation, that the exclusion was not handled diplomatically. Indeed, \\xa0Suskind writes that Summers and Emanuel were “notoriously brusque, but even more abrupt and dismissive of women.”\\xa0 Geithner states that Romer was “of ‘no value on policy issues’ of ‘financial rescue.’”\\xa0 Romer herself said on one occasion, “Tim and Larry will handle that, always Larry and Tim, and I sort of wondered, aren’t I supposed to be the third leg of the stool.”\\xa0\\xa0 As many other women in the Obama administration received similar treatment, Suskind goes on to treat this as a case of sexism, which it might have been, but there is a more innocent explanation that I will return to in a moment.', '“Confidence Men” is a worthy read for economists considering a public life because the experiences of the economists in the Obama administration are so common to economists that pursue a political career. The personal anecdotes are food for thought, and an important caution about what can happen if you are not vigilant when you come to Washington.', 'An economist willing to give policy advice is presented with a clear problem. Very often, the balance of evidence provides incomplete information regarding the likely impact of any policy change. What would happen, for example, if the top marginal income tax rate were lifted to 40 percent, or cut to 30 percent?\\xa0 How about 50 and 20?\\xa0 Obviously there is a diversity of opinion on that matter, and the question is, what should the economic advisor recommend?', 'With the risk of sounding like someone accelerating towards his dotage, I can say that I have been in the room with economists and decision makers countless times, and one thing I have often learned is that the economist that has the most influence on the decision is often the economist that exudes the most confidence. Over time, then, economic teams tend to be divided up between those who are aggressive, convincing and influential, and those who are grumpy and feel excluded from the process.', 'A corollary of this observation is that any smart economist immersed in the White House policy process will rapidly learn that oozing confidence is a ticket to power. Over time, the positive feedback for confidence can significantly shape the individual. A neutral observer might, for example, read the work of Romer and wonder how it would be that a person whose work provides such a rich diversity of results regarding the influence of tax rate reductions versus government spending on the economy might have become such a strident advocate for the a textbook Keynesian stimulus that makes no concessions to competing views. The answer is one every economist must confront: the internal workings of the policy process made her that way. If you compare the Christy Romer you saw at a conference in 2005 to the Romer you saw in 2009 who was positively hostile to economists arguing for less reliance on Keynesian policies, then you begin to understand the forces that could, over many years, produce behavior like that of Larry Summers.', 'The dirty secret of White House is that everybody is struggling for position, and everybody wants to hold the meeting without inviting you. I doubt that Larry Summers was acting as a sexist when he attempted to exclude Romer from the decision process since virtually everyone in every White House works tirelessly to exclude rivals from the decision process.', 'This was true in the Bush administration as well. Once, a friend took a senior economic position under President Bush and called up to ask for advice. My first suggestion was that he hire a specific individual to be his right hand, as that individual is famously assertive and will make sure he is in every meeting he needs to be. A while later, someone else on that person’s staff called up to recount how one of President Bush’s top political advisers had taken him aside and asked about my friend’s hire as follows: “who the ‘heck’ is this person?”\\xa0 Clearly, my friend was being served well.', 'This is what you can expect if you are an economist and you get involved in presidential politics. First, once your candidate becomes successful, everyone will want your job, and Nobel Prize winners will call the candidate and tell him he should replace you. Second, if you survive that throughout the campaign, you will face a more concerted assault during the transition, when powerful forces work to replace you with their favorite. Third, once you begin serving in government, you will likely spend more time fending off personal assaults and fighting not to be excluded than you could possibly have expected. Finally, the personalities and actions of your colleagues will defy belief. I have seen far worse than the behavior Suskind describes in his book.', 'But you should serve the country anyway. The stakes are high, and our world is immeasurably better because so many economists of both parties have been willing to tolerate this insane environment, if only for a year or two. As bad as our economic policies can be at times, they would have been far worse without the input of economists.', 'A potential president who reads “Confidence Men” would learn that his policy team needs to be run by a man who is an honest broker, who has the confidence to delegate responsibility to the appropriate department, and the competence to encourage and resolve disputes collegially. Such a man will have command of an impressive apparatus that has the potential to achieve much good. Suskind suggests that Obama himself has learned this lesson, and I can say with great confidence that his choice of Gene Sperling as Summers’ replacement suggests he has.', 'An economist would be lucky to serve in an administration that is collegial and well organized, but it probably will not happen for most. That is why “Confidence Men” is must reading for economists.', 'Not surprisingly, as data security breaches and cyberattacks against large companies continue to be highly publicized, awareness of cyber risk and the need for cybersecurity continues to increase. Of the 29 global risks discussed in the World Economic Forum’s\\xa0Global Risks Report 2016,\\xa0large-scale cyberattacks\\xa0is ranked as the eleventh most likely global risk, and\\xa0massive incident of\\xa0data fraud or theft\\xa0is ranked eighth. Remarkably, however, the Report also indicates that perhaps the evolving nature of cyber risk — from seemingly isolated attacks against specific companies, such as entertainment and electronic giant Sony in 2104, to system-wide attacks with the potential for massive cascading effects, as recently occurred in Ukraine — is not fully understood.', 'Our cyber dependence and the digital connectivity of systems, assets, data and networks continues to grow, increasing the interconnection of risks and the potential for cascading effects resulting from a cyber incident. As a result, cyberattacks can lead to breakdowns, outages and disruptions to entire systems — not just individual components or entities. Today’s cyber risk is systemic. And yet, two risks closely interconnected to large-scale cyberattacks rank much lower in the Report. The\\xa0failure/shortfall of critical infrastructure\\xa0is perceived to be the sixth least likely and the second least impactful risk, and the\\xa0breakdown of critical information infrastructure and networks\\xa0has continued to decrease in perceived impact over the last few years, and is considered among the least likely global risks to occur after unmanageable inflation, weapons of mass destruction and the rapid and massive spread of infectious disease. This disconnect seems to indicate an ignorance of the systemic nature of cyber risk today. These interconnected risks do not exist in a vacuum — as cyberattacks and their impacts increase — so too will the likelihood and impacts of closely interconnected risks.', 'Enterprise risk management (ERM) programs and approaches must evolve to meet the changing and expanding nature of systemic cyber risk. Risk managers should increase their awareness and understanding and should consider the following:', '(1) Hollywood Scripts Become Reality: Enterprise Risk Must Include the Risk to Global Systems.', 'The horizon and landscape assessed through ERM must include global systems upon which we all increasingly rely to operate. ‘The enterprise’ is no longer limited to an entity’s owned or controlled systems, networks, and assets. A successful cyberattack on global critical infrastructure systems such as transportation, electricity grids, or financial payment, clearing and settlement systems could potentially adversely affect all entities that rely on them to transact and operate business and government services. Such risks must be assessed and included in ERM. For example, an attack on payment and settlement systems by a sophisticated actor could not only disable the ability of consumers and businesses to make transactions but could, if not effectively mitigated, adversely affect national economies.', 'Recent events such as the Ukrainian rolling blackout, believed to be the result of hacking, demonstrate that physical and cyber interdependencies can result in systemic level disruptions or failures — it is no longer only the imaginings of Hollywood script writers. Further, disruptions of underlying or enabling critical information infrastructure such as positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) technologies could disrupt critical functions and services in turn causing outages or disruptions to power grids, banks, communications networks or air traffic control systems. Micro or seemingly isolated incidents have the potential to quickly morph into a chain of adverse consequences that cross geographical, sectoral and time boundaries.', '(2) Isolated to Cascading Consequences: Assess Consequences of System Risk Systemically.', 'Systemic risks result in systemic consequences and yet despite the fact that the risk of\\xa0massive data theft/ fraud\\xa0is considered to be of similar likelihood to cyberattacks, it continues to rank well below average in terms of perceived impact. This seems startling, given the frequency, volume and invasive nature of the breaches reported in 2015 from sectors as diverse as financial services, travel, health and government entities. The breach of the U.S. Office of Personal Management alone resulted in the exposure of extremely personal information — such as Social Security numbers, fingerprints, residency, education, employment, health, criminal and financial history, and information about immediate family and acquaintances — for 21.5 million individuals.', 'Perhaps the respondents perceived the risk impact to be relatively low because most often the immediate consequences and costs of known breaches amount to annoyances for most affected. But in fact, the expansive nature of recent data breaches demonstrates that the immediate effects and cost of response are just the tip of the impact iceberg. The longer-term systemic and aggregated consequences of data breaches for businesses include a loss of trust and reputation at the industry level, costs associated with adjusting business plans and strategies to address changes in consumer behavior and preferences, and an increased risk of litigation, regulation and compliance reporting. Businesses and governments need a deeper understanding of the long-term potential systemic consequences of seemingly isolated cyber incidents- data theft/fraud is but one type of cyber incident. The quantification of systemic risks must include assessing actual and potential consequences systemically.', '(3) Your Risk is My Risk: Partner to Build Resilience', 'By their evolving nature today, cyber threats cannot be addressed in isolation. Increasingly,\\xa0your\\xa0cyber risk becomes\\xa0myrisk if we are virtually connected, and a system’s aggregated risk becomes the risk of\\xa0all\\xa0component users and contributors. No one entity has all of the authorities, capabilities and capacities to address all possible attack vectors, shore up all possible vulnerabilities and address the risk of all connections. We must work together leveraging our unique perspectives, expertise and operating environments. Risk managers should seek to partner with their suppliers (and suppliers’ suppliers), customers, and industry colleagues to pursue an integrated approach to protecting assets, information and systems logically connected throughout the enterprise.', 'As the Fourth Industrial Revolution unfolds, increasing hyperconnectivity, digitization and rapid technological innovation are forever changing and complicating our global risk landscape. Cyber related risks continue to present risk managers with unique considerations, scenarios and consequences. The next generation of cyber enterprise risk managers must study and understand the systems and networks in which their organization participate and upon which they rely. It is only through more fully understanding system characteristics, the full scope of both uses and users, and component systems and networks that we can — in partnership — hope to effectively manage the systemic nature of cyber risk including diffused system vulnerabilities, single points of failure and over-dependency on critical nodes of systems and networks.', 'Quote: “America is open for business, and we are competitive once again.” End quote. That was just one of the key lines in President Trump’s highly successful Davos speech this week.', 'Of course, in going to Davos, Trump entered the lion’s den.

Back then, elitist heads of state, the EU bureaucrats, and the international CEOs were uniformly against Donald Trump.', 'But Trump’s 2018 Davos strategy was a brilliant stroke.', 'A year later he could make the fact-based argument that, in his words, “The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America.” And the core of his message was this: “There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the United States.”', 'He’s right.', 'Trump’s polices, in just one year, have begun to restructure the American economy. We’ve moved from “secular stagnation” (i.e., high taxes, massive regulation, huge government spending, and a disdain for business and investors) to a new private-sector incentive system that\\xa0rewards\\xa0success.', 'By slashing individual and corporate tax rates, providing 100% immediate expensing for plants and technology, and making it easy for big companies who fled our high-tax system to bring the money back home, he has ended the war against business and investment.', 'And it has happened faster than anyone imagined possible.', 'More than 250 American companies have announced gigantic investment projects, paid sizeable bonuses to their workforces, increased 401(k) contributions, and raised corporate minimum wages and other benefits.', 'And now, a roaring stock market, generating $7 trillion in new wealth, provides the only realistic chance of bailing out excessive government-union pensions and benefits — even though these very unions totally opposed Trump’s corporate tax reform.', 'Ankle-biting Democrats say, “Rising business profits will go to shareholder buybacks.” As if that were a bad thing. Meanwhile, new money is circulating throughout the economy to start new companies and re-oxygenate the system.', 'Didn’t Apple just announce $ 350 billion in new investment projects?', 'Democrats say the incredible business response to tax reform is nothing more than one-time crumbs for workers. But didn’t Walmart — which has bitterly fought attempts to raise the federal minimum wage — just raise its internal minimum wage for virtually all its wage earners, give bonuses of up to $1,000, expand maternity and parental leave, and commit $5,000 to every employee who adopts a child?', 'That’s\\xa0permanent, as are increased retirement-fund contributions.', 'The post-tax-and-regulatory reform policies of the Trump administration have barely been put in place, yet they’re already benefiting working folks around the country. These are people who have barely had a raise in\\xa020 years.', 'Trump’s critics belittled the idea that corporate tax cuts could actually\\xa0increasewages. But in faster than a New York minute, several million wage earners have already benefitted.', 'Then there are the know-it-all critics who say there’s no academic evidence to support the view that business taxes matter for the workforce.', 'Yet peer-reviewed papers — from respected economists Alan Auerbach, Laurence Kotlikoff, and the Romer family — conclude that higher after-tax returns to capital generate investment. I’ve been saying this for a long time. With more capital behind each worker there’s greater productivity. And new investment projects raise the demand for workers and their wages.', 'And don’t forget the president’s argument about the importance of regulatory reduction. “Regulation is stealth taxation,” Trump said in Davos. “We are freeing our businesses and workers so they can thrive and flourish as never before.” Don’t forget that the Trump tax bill ended the Obamacare individual mandate and opened the door to energy drilling in ANWR. And then, in Davos, the president offered a fantastic point on the so-called debate over globalism and trade: “As president of the United States,” he said, “I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their countries first also.\\xa0But America first does not mean America alone.” [Italics mine.]', 'In an illuminating interview with my friend and CNBC colleague Joe Kernan, Trump said he’s willing to deal on trade — including NAFTA, and perhaps the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But he correctly insisted on reciprocity. Barriers should be torn down by both sides. Arbitrations must protect America, not penalize it.', '“I’m a free trader,” he said. “A fair-trader. But there must be reciprocity.”', 'He also told Kernan that the U.S. dollar will strengthen based on America’s resurgence, and that it will remain the world’s reserve currency.', 'So, America First came to Davos, and to all the multi-lateral globalists and multi-nationalist elites. And these CEOs, bureaucrats, and academics listened carefully to Trump’s words.', 'Success has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan', '——————', 'This tax plan will spark an investment boom that will benefit everyone.', 'Warts and all, if I were a voting member of Congress, I would certainly cast a “yea” vote for the tax-cut plan passed by the Senate and House and headed for conference (to work out minor differences) in the weeks ahead.', 'These bills are not perfect, especially on the individual side. But the business tax cuts will generate an investment boom in the years ahead. And those cuts will bring economic growth back to its historical norm of 3 to 4 percent.', 'Incredibly, the Joint Tax Committee (JTC) scored growth for the Senate plan at less than 1 percent. So much for their “dynamic” model. The Tax Foundation estimates 3 to 5 percent growth over the next ten years. That’s more like it, but it’s still too low.', 'Look, the central cause of the 2 percent real-GDP growth slump over the past 17 years has been a lack of capital formation, with virtually no real business investment, flattened productivity, and barely any increase in real workforce wages.', 'Yet the tax plans under discussion — which go back to the work of Steve Moore, Steven Mnuchin, Stephen Miller, Art Laffer, Steve Forbes, and myself — are remarkably similar to the Trump campaign draft on the business side.', 'So I can say with confidence that the current tax package is\\xa0directly\\xa0aimed at reducing the current high tax cost of capital and increasing after-tax returns from investment.', 'Incentives matter. If it pays more after tax to build new capital stock and generate more business-equipment investment, people will do so. This is standard economics.', 'There may be disagreements on the numerical effects, but the principle has worked in the past (JFK and Reagan) and will work in the future.', 'A 20 percent corporate tax rate, immediate full expensing, repatriation of U.S. corporate cash overseas, and a 23 percent discount for sub-chapter S pass-throughs (much credit to Senator Ron Johnson for this) will generate way more growth and investment than mainstream forecasters suggest.', 'At various times, President Trump has talked about 3 percent, 4 percent, and even 5 percent growth. Despite the dreary mainstream models, I believe the president will turn out to be correct.', 'What’s more, faster economic growth will generate much higher tax revenues. From businesses to investors to entrepreneurial startups, less tax avoidance and sheltering will raise revenues far beyond the standard consensus estimate.', 'Supply-siders like myself always buck the trend on pricing out lower tax rates. But again, we were right in the ’60s, ’80s, and ’90s, running against the tide. So I suggest history will repeat itself.', 'By the way, in terms of the revenue hunt going on in Congress, I wish somebody would look at the lowball estimates compiled by the JTC with respect to repatriation. The JTC estimates $25 billion in 2018, $21 billion in 2019, and $6 billion to $7 billion in the three years following. This is nuts.', 'Assuming about $3 trillion coming back home at an average tax rate of 10 percent, that’s\\xa0$300 billion\\xa0in new revenues — way beyond the JTC estimate. And that’s conservative. It could be $350 billion in the first year or two — substantially more revenue and a way bigger pay-for than the JTC predicts.', 'And there’s more on the dynamic side. Booming stock market gains of roughly $6 trillion of late could generate another $600 billion or $700 billion in revenues from capital gains, and hundreds of billions of dollars more in dividends, which generate massive revenue increases.', 'None of this is scored. The government forecasters don’t understand international flows and the interactions of stocks, capital gains, and dividends. Their estimates are probably several trillion revenue dollars short. \\xa0', 'Sure, there are things on the individual side that should be changed. Personal tax rates should be much lower. A backdoor capital-gains tax hike on individual investors must be erased. And the proliferation of tax credits is inefficient and complex, with no marginal incentives to promote growth.', 'Yes, everybody likes kids. But not everyone has them. And a lot of people like dogs and cats. Shouldn’t they get tax credits, too? No. If you’re looking for more money in your pocket — more take-home pay — the best prescription is to\\xa0slash\\xa0personal tax rates for\\xa0everyone.', '(By the way, why didn’t Congress end the carried-interest loophole for private-equity firms?)', 'But here’s the crux of the matter: An investment boom generating much faster growth will benefit\\xa0everyone. Small businesses, new businesses, investors, and wage earners will\\xa0all\\xa0prosper from a tax-cut-led investment boom.', 'Yes, a rising tide will lift all boats. The great news is that President Trump, the Senate, and the House are absolutely moving in the right direction, and gathering momentum on the way.', 'I’d vote for it. You should, too.', '_______________', 'Two giants weigh in on a return to prosperity.', 'I participated in perhaps a bit of radio history last week when Steve Forbes and Art Laffer joined me on my syndicated radio show. It may have been the first time these supply-side-economics giants were ever together over the airwaves.', 'Forbes, of course, is chairman of Forbes Media and twice ran brilliant issue-campaigns for president. And Laffer, once a key advisor to President Reagan, is father to the ground-breaking Laffer curve, for which he should have won a Nobel prize. In our discussion together, they didn’t disappoint. (For a full transcript,\\xa0click here.)', 'We started with “one big idea.” That’s how the late Jack Kemp approached economic-policy reform back in the 1980s. And his big idea, embraced by Reagan, was a mix of low marginal tax rates to spur economic-growth incentives and a sound, reliable dollar to conquer inflation and create confidence. (This duplicated the Kennedy prosperity model, which Brian Domitrovic and I wrote about in\\xa0JFK and the Reagan Revolution.)', 'But these days, if you adhere to that big idea, you’re ridiculed as clinging to the past. My guests would have none of it.', '“We need it now more than ever,” said Forbes. “To say that just because it worked 40 years ago, therefore, it’s old, is like saying the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are old, therefore we can cast them aside.”', 'Forbes’s version of “one big idea” is a flat tax and a sound dollar linked to gold. If we have that, we’ll be the “land of opportunity again.”', 'Laffer agreed. “Our economic verities have remained forever,” he said. “They go back to caveman, pre-cavemen. Incentives matter: If you reward an activity, then people do more of it. If you punish an activity, people do less of it.”', 'But for the tax side of “one big idea,” Laffer would like to see corporate tax reform. I agree. Reagan used to say, “Give me half a loaf now, and I’ll get the other half later.” Well, I’d take the half loaf of corporate tax cuts right now.', 'And that would work for Forbes, who can see income-tax reform\\xa0following\\xa0corporate-tax reform. “Even if we get to this two years down the road,” he said, “I think [Trump would] be amenable to doing something radical like a flat tax.”', 'But why is it that our Democratic friends in the economics profession and politics work so hard to discredit the idea of lowering marginal tax rates on the extra dollar earned to spark the positive incentives that lead to prosperity?', '“Let me put it just succinctly,” answered Laffer. “These people are willing to rebut arguments they know to be true in order to curry favors with their political benefactors.”', 'To which Forbes added: “A lot of these far-left ideologues would rather have a smaller economy and more government power than a bigger economy and a smaller government.”', 'From that sad truth we moved to prosperity killers, in particular trade protectionism, about which there is still much talk within the Trump camp. Where, I asked, does trade protectionism — including tariffs on China — fit into the low-tax-rate, strong-dollar prosperity model?', '“It doesn’t,” said Forbes, who offered an alternative: “The smart approach is get this economy moving through. . . tax cuts and deregulation. And then having a stable dollar . . . you sit down country by country and remove trade barriers.” Anything but the trade protectionism that blew up the stock market in 1929.', 'To which Laffer added the great line: “Don’t just stand there, undo something!”', '“Cut taxes, stabilize the dollar, reduce tariffs, reduce regulation,” he said. “Undo, undo, undo — and undo the damages these other guys have done.”', 'One of those damages is Obamacare. And the fear now is that it will never get undone.', 'But my guests were optimistic, if philosophical. How will we get true, free-market, health-care reform?', '“You do this . . . sometimes with great leaps, but sometimes step by step,” said Forbes.', 'To which Laffer added: “With any type of change that we can make in the right direction . . . never let the best be the enemy of the good.”', 'Finally, I asked, “Is the free-market model losing ground?” We’ve seen its decline in Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere.', '“This thing always ebbs and flows,” said Laffer. “Reagan, at first, was dissed by all the foreign leaders, except for Thatcher. And once our success story came in, he’s now virtually a god. That’s going to happen again, believe me.”', 'The limits of this space have forced me to drastically abbreviate what I do believe was a historic radio event. Two economic giants met and discussed the big ideas that will restore growth and prosperity. They offered the “how,” and were confident that the “when” is near.', '_____________', 'In Warsaw, he called the Russian president’s energy bully-bluff.', 'A few years back, in one of his finest moments, Senator John McCain said on a Sunday talk show that “Russia is a gas station masquerading as a country.” It was right when he said it, and it’s even more right today.', 'Vladimir Putin’s circle of corrupt oligarchs gouge whatever money they can from the impoverished Russian economy and move it to bank accounts overseas. And they do this after giving Putin his cut, after which he apparently also sends the money overseas.', 'Many say Putin is the richest man in Russia, worth billions and billions. So the old Soviet model of the\\xa0nomenklatura\\xa0Communist bureaucrats getting rich while the rest of the country declines is still in place.', 'But with energy prices falling, Vladimir Putin’s Russia has essentially been in a recession over the past four years. With oil at $50 a barrel or less, Russian budgets plunge deeper into debt. It’s even doubtful the Russians have enough money to upgrade their military-energy industrial complex.', 'Through crafty media relations and his own bravado, a deluded Putin struggles to maintain the illusion that Russia is a strong economic power. But it ain’t so. Not even close.', 'Now, Russia still has a lot of oil and gas reserves. And it uses this to bully Eastern and Western Europe. It threatens to cut off these resources if Europe dares to complain about Putin power-grabs in Crimea, eastern Ukraine, the Baltics, and elsewhere.', 'But enter President Donald Trump. In his brilliant speech in Warsaw, Poland, earlier this week, he called Putin’s energy bluff.', 'It may well have been the best speech of his young presidency. Trump delivered a stirring leadership message, emphasizing the importance of God, freedom, strong families, and democratic values.', 'And while unambiguously pledging to uphold NATO’s Article 5 — committing the members to protect one another — Trump went even deeper: “The fundamental question of our time,” he said, “is whether the West has the will to survive. Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost?”', 'He said, “if we do not have strong families and strong values, then we will be weak and we will not survive.” He also spoke several times of the religious leadership and bravery of Pope John Paul II.', 'It was a bold strike for the West.', 'But in an absolutely\\xa0key\\xa0part of the speech, he took direct aim at Vladimir Putin’s energy bullying.', 'Trump said, “We are committed to securing your access to alternative sources of energy so Poland and its neighbors are never again held hostage to a single supplier of energy.” Italics are all mine.', 'President Donald Trump has quickly made it clear that Barack Obama’s war on business is over. He’s also made it clear, through regulatory rollbacks of breathtaking scope, that the Obama war on fossil fuels is over.', 'Trump wants America to achieve energy dominance. He withdrew from the costly Paris climate accord, which would have severely damaged the American economy. He directed the EPA to rescind the Obama Clean Power Plan, which would have led to skyrocketing electricity rates. He fast-tracked the Keystone XL pipeline. He reopened the door for a modernized American coal industry. He’s overturning all the Obama obstacles to hydraulic fracturing, which his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton would have dramatically increased. And he has opened the floodgates wide to energy exports.', 'Right now, U.S. oil reserves are almost in parity with those of Saudi Arabia. We have the second-most coal reserves in the world. There are enough U.S. gas reserves to last us a century. We have already passed Russia as the world’s top natural-gas producer. We are the world’s top producer of oil and petroleum hydrocarbons. And exports of liquified national gas are surging, with the Energy Department rapidly approving new LNG projects and other export terminals.', 'All these America-first energy policies are huge economic-growth and high-wage-job producers at home. But in the Warsaw speech, Trump made it clear that America’s energy dominance will be used to help our friends across Europe. No longer will our allies have to rely on Russian Gazprom supplies with inflated, prosperity-killing prices.', 'In short, with the free-market policies he’s putting in place in America’s energy sector and throughout the U.S. economy, the businessman president fully intends to destroy Russia’s energy-market share. And as that takes hold, Russia’s gas-station economy will sink further.', 'And as\\xa0that\\xa0takes hold, bully-boy Putin will have to think twice about Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltics. He’ll have to think twice about his anti-American policies in the Middle East and North Korea. And he’ll have to think twice about his increasingly precarious position as the modern-day Russian tsar.', 'And the world may yet become a safer place.', 'Trump has Putin over a barrel.', 'On Clinton', '———————', 'With the news on August 17th that the President of the United States lied to the American people (and very likely under oath) about an illicit relationship with a college student, readers are no doubt wondering \"where to from here?\" The two schools of thought can be summed up in the choices presented through various and diverse sources, namely, move on or move out.', 'The \"move on\" crowd\\'s argument goes something like this; \\'the President admitted he made a mistake, you have your pound of flesh, now let\\'s move on with the serious issues facing the country\\'. While this approach is appealing even to some of us who have little regard for the policies of this Administration, it\\'s just not as simple as all that. The \\'Move On Crowd\\'s argument is predicated on the notion that presidents, just like the rest of us, ought to be entitled to a little privacy. This argument fails on two grounds; (A) President Clinton made this issue public when he denied it eight months ago and (B) President Clinton is not, by definition, \\'like the rest of us\\'.', \"On the first count, the President has admitted to having taken advantage of a college intern working at the White House (that's a public building) who was on the White House Staff (that's public employment) on many occasion in and around the Oval Office (again a public building). Also, the President lied about the affair in public and (very likely) under oath in Jones vs Clinton. He also may have used the power of his PUBLIC office to cover up the whole sordid matter. This was not a private matter and cannot legitimately be argued as such. A truly private matter in this realm might be an affair between the President and a friend not working in the White House for whom no favors were granted and no cover-up attempted. That, it seems to me, could be argued as part of one's (immoral) private life. Ms. Lewinski is a part of the President's public life not his private life.\", \"On the second count, that the President is 'just like the rest of us', he is the most powerful man in the world. If you and I fall into bad moral habits, we can harm our families, our employers and our friends. The President of the United States can incinerate the planet. Seriously, the very idea that we ought to have at or less than the same moral demands placed on the Chief Executive that we place on our next door neighbor is ludicrous and dangerous. Throughout our history, we have seen the presidency as the repository of all of our highest hopes and ideals and values. To demand less is to do an injustice to the blood that bought our freedoms.\", 'So we get to the other, and in my view, only school of thought remaining. For America to move on, and we must, the Clintons must move out of the White House. Either the President should resign or be removed from office. Nothing short of this sad conclusion will suffice to restore the institution of the presidency to its former and necessary glory.\"\\u2028', '————————————', 'Why Clinton Must Be Impeached', \"It has been rightly observed that we are a government of laws and not of men, and, I would add, neither are we are government of the opinions of men and women. To follow the debate over the fate of the Clinton Administration, in the wake of the Presidents admission to having become sexually involved with a college student working at the White House, is to witness a national press corps unfamiliar with the aforementioned edict. With the intense media attention paid to the president's approval ratings before and after his half confession/half excuse speech, a passive observer might conclude that we live in a pure democracy, the likes of which was sought in the French Revolution. In such a realm, the Supreme Law of the Land is the Vox Populi, literally 'the voice of the people'. There is no law apart from what the people recognize to be the law at any given time. This was best illustrated to me recently by a security guard who approached as I read a front page story about the President and the polls and sarcastically asked, 'what is the law today?'.\\xa0\", 'News flash to the major media networks: we live in a constitutional republic. We are governed by written constitution which defines, among other things, the rights, privileges and responsibilities of high office with great clarity. Under Article II, Section 1 the executive power of the United States of America is vested in the President. In the oath of office proscribed, a president commits to faithfully execute the office and preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\\xa0', 'While the office brings with it the duties that attend the administration of the government, as President Herbert C. Hoover wrote, \"The Presidency is more than executive responsibility. It is the inspiring supreme symbol of all that is highest in our American ideals.\" When a president fails to fulfill his oath of office, as is the case where the law is broken in a big way or a small way (another way of saying high crimes or misdemeanors), the Constitution provides for a mechanism whereby the legislative branch might impeach him.\\xa0', 'This may seem drastic to the average American. It is. Our founders intended it to be so because they intended the President of the United States to be the center of the government of the United States. Other constructs were considered, including the appointment of a prime minister-like president by the legislative branch, but all were rejected in favor of a strong and elected President. Alexander Hamilton defended this concept in \\'The Federalist\\' writing, \"the Executive is a leading characteristic in the definition of good government... it is essential to the steady administration of the law.\" Hamilton also cautioned against long suffering where a President failed to meet this high standard, writing, \"a feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of government. A feeble Executive is but another name for a bad executive; and a government ill-executed... must be proclaimed a bad government.\"\\xa0', 'Against this recitation of the Supreme Law of the Land, only one sad conclusion attaches; President Bill Clinton must resign or be removed from the office of President of the United States.\\xa0\\xa0', \"Despite his absurd assertions to the contrary, President Clinton's admission to a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky stands in diametric opposition to his sworn testimony in the Jones vs. Clinton case. The President's responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the land begins in his own administration. The President committed perjury. Perjury is a crime. President's who commit crimes should resign or be impeached.\\xa0\", 'Further, the Presidents repeated lies to the American people in this matter compound the case against him as they demonstrate his failure to protect the institution of the presidency as the \\'inspiring supreme symbol of all that is highest in our American ideals\\'. Leaders affect the lives of families far beyond their own \\'private life\\'. In the Bible story of Esther we are told of a king who was charged to put right his own household because there would be \"no end of disrespect and discord\" among the families of the kingdom if he failed to do so. In a day when reckless extramarital sexual activity is manifesting itself in our staggering rates of illegitimacy and divorce, now more than ever, America needs to be able to look to her First Family as role models of all that we have been and can be again.\\xa0', 'The challenge for the Republican Congress lies in the fact that the polls may be right. The American people may deeply wish to move on and put this unpleasantness behind us. Regrettably, the Constitution does not permit such a national denial. If the President does not resign, the Republican Congress must impeach him even if it costs them their majority because the laws of this republic charge them with the duty to so act. Absent an uncharacteristic act of selflessness by the President, it is left to the Republicans to live up to their label and defend the laws and institutions of this Republic. If our leaders flinch at this responsibility, they would do well to heed the Proverb \"if a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked\". Our leaders must either act to restore the luster and dignity of the institution of the Presidency or we can be certain that this is only the beginning of an even more difficult time for our land. For the nation to move on, the President must move out.\\xa0', '\\u2028\\xa0', 'Thank you all. Thank you.  Thank you very much. Well, thank you, Fred, for that kind introduction.

There are many faith backgrounds and many different walks of life, and that’s a good thing, and not all Iranian Americans see things the same way. But I think everyone can agree that the regime in Iran has been a nightmare for the Iranian people, and it is important that your unity on that point is not diminished by differences elsewhere.', 'To our Iranian American and – to our Iranian American friends, tonight I want to tell you that the Trump administration dreams the same dreams for the people of Iran as you do, and through our labors and God’s providence that day will come true. ', 'Next year will mark the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. As I’ll spell out more in a moment, the 40 years of fruit from the revolution has been bitter. Forty years of kleptocracy. Forty years of the people’s wealth squandered on supporting terrorism. Forty years of ordinary Iranians thrown in jail for peaceful expression of their rights. Why has the regime conducted itself in such an abhorrent way over the past 40 years and subjected its people to these conditions? It’s an important question.', 'The answer is at root in the revolutionary nature of the regime itself. ', 'The ideologues who forcibly came to power in 1979 and remain in power today are driven by a desire to conform all of Iranian society to the tenets of the Islamic Revolution. The regime is also committed to spreading the revolution to other countries, by force if necessary. The total fulfillment of the revolution at home and abroad is the regime’s ultimate goal. It drives their behavior. Thus, the regime has spent four decades mobilizing all elements of the Iranian economy, foreign policy, and political life in service of that objective. To the regime, prosperity, security, and freedom for the Iranian people are acceptable casualties in the march to fulfill the revolution.', 'Economically, we see how the regime’s decision to prioritize an ideological agenda over the welfare of the Iranian people has put Iran into a long-term economic tailspin. During the time of the nuclear deal, Iran’s increased oil revenues could have gone to improving the lives of the Iranian people. Instead they went to terrorists, dictators, and proxy militias. Today, thanks to regime subsidies, the average Hizballah combatant makes two to three times what an Iranian firefighter makes on the streets of Iran. Regime mismanagement has led to the rial plummeting in value. A third of Iranian youth are unemployed, and a third of Iranians now live below the poverty line.', 'The bitter irony of the economic situation in Iran is that the regime uses this same time to line its own pockets while its people cry out for jobs and reform and for opportunity. The Iranian economy is going great – but only if you’re a politically-connected member of the elite. Two years ago, Iranians rightfully erupted in anger when leaked paystubs showed massive amounts of money inexplicably flowing into the bank accounts of senior government officials.', 'And there are many more examples of the widespread corruption.', 'Take Sadeq Larijani, the head of Iran’s judiciary. He is worth at least $300 million dollars. He got this money from embezzling public funds into his own bank account. The Trump administration sanctioned Larijani in January for human rights abuses, because we aren’t afraid to tackle the regime at its highest level.  Call me crazy – you won’t be the first – but I’m a little skeptical that a thieving thug under international sanctions is the right man to be Iran’s highest-ranking judicial official. ', 'Former IRGC officer and Minister of Interior Sadeq Mahsouli is nicknamed “the Billionaire General.” He went from being a poor IRGC officer at the end of the Iran-Iraq war to being worth billions of dollars. How’d that happen? He somehow had a knack for winning lucrative construction and oil trading contracts from businesses associated with the IRGC. Being an old college buddy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad just might have had something to do with it as well. ', 'The ayatollahs are in on the act, too. Judging by their vast wealth, they seem more concerned with riches than religion. These hypocritical holy men have devised all kinds of crooked schemes to become some of the wealthiest men on Earth while their people suffer.', 'Grand Ayatollah Makaram Shirazi is known as the “Sultan of Sugar” for his illicit trading of sugar, which has generated over $100 million for him. He has pressured the Iranian Government to lower subsidies to domestic sugar producers while he floods the market with his own more expensive imported sugar. This type of activity puts ordinary Iranians out of work.', 'Another ayatollah, one of Tehran’s Friday prayer leaders for the last 30 years, had the government transfer several lucrative mines to his foundation. He too is now worth millions of dollars.', 'And not many people know this, but the Ayatollah Khamenei has his own personal, off-the-books hedge fund called the Setad, worth $95 billion, with a B. That wealth is untaxed, it is ill-gotten, and it is used as a slush fund for the IRGC. The ayatollah fills his coffers by devouring whatever he wants. In 2013 the Setad’s agents banished an 82-year-old Baha’i woman from her apartment and confiscated the property after a long campaign of harassment. Seizing land from religious minorities and political rivals is just another day at the office for this juggernaut that has interests in everything from real estate to telecoms to ostrich farming. All of it is done with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei.', 'This list goes on, but we’ve got places to go tonight. The level of corruption and wealth among Iranian leaders shows that Iran is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government.', 'On foreign policy, the regime’s mission of exporting the revolution has produced a decades-long campaign of ideologically-motivated violence and destabilization abroad. Assad, Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, Shia militant groups in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen feed on billions of regime cash while the Iranian people shout slogans like “Leave Syria, think about us.”', 'Our partners in the Middle East are plagued by Iranian cyberattacks and threatening behavior in the waters of the Persian Gulf. The regime and its allies in terror have left a trail of dissident blood across Europe and the Middle East.', 'Indeed, our European allies are not immune to the threat of regime-backed terrorism.', 'Just earlier this month, an Iranian “diplomat” based in Vienna was arrested and charged with supplying explosives for a terrorist bomb scheduled to bomb a political rally in France. This tells you everything you need to know about the regime: At the same time they’re trying to convince Europe to stay in the nuclear deal, they’re covertly plotting terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe.', 'And because fighting the United States and destroying Israel is at the core of the regime’s ideology, it has committed and supported many acts of violence and terrorism against both countries and our citizens. As just one example, well over a thousand American service members have been killed and wounded in Iraq from Iranian-made IEDs.', 'Today, multiple Americans are detained and missing inside of Iran. Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang are unjustly held by the regime to this day, and Bob Levinson has been missing in Iran for over 11 years. There are others, too. And we in the Trump administration are working diligently to bring each of those Americans home from having been wrongfully detained for far too long. You know, despite the regime’s clear record of aggression, America and other countries have spent years straining to identify a political moderate. It’s like an Iranian unicorn.  The regime’s revolutionary goals and willingness to commit violent acts haven’t produced anyone to lead Iran that can be remotely called a moderate or a statesman.', 'Some believe that President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif fit that bill. The truth is they are merely polished front men for the ayatollahs’ international con artistry. Their nuclear deal didn’t make them moderates; it made them wolves in sheep’s clothing. Governments around the world worry that confronting the Islamic Republic harms the cause of moderates, but these so-called moderates within the regime are still violent Islamic revolutionaries with an anti-America, anti-West agenda. You only have to take their own words for it. And for that matter, the evidence reveals that their agenda is a anti-Iran agenda as well.', 'The regime’s absolute adherence to the Islamic Revolution mean it cannot endure any ideas in the Iranian society that would contradict or undermine it – unlike we just did here this evening. It’s why the regime has for decades heartlessly repressed its own people’s human rights, dignity, and fundamental freedoms.', 'It’s why the Iranian police detained a teenage Iranian gymnast for posting an Instagram video of herself dancing.', 'It’s why the regime arrests hundreds of Ahwazis, members of Iran’s minority Arab community, when they speak out to demand respect for their language and for their basic beliefs. The government’s morality police beat women in the streets and arrest those who do not wish to wear the hijab.', 'On “White Wednesday” activist recently – one activist was recently sentenced to 20 years in prison for protesting compulsory hijab wearing.', 'The desire to uphold the Islamic Revolution has especially resulted in gross suppression of the freedom of religion in Iran, often to barbaric ends.', 'Last month, a simple man, a bus driver, a father of two children, and a member of the Iranian Gonabadi Sufi Dervish Community, was convicted and sentenced to death. His sentence came on questionable grounds following violent clashes between security forces and the Dervishes. He was reportedly denied access to a lawyer before, during – before and during his grossly unfair trial. This man, Mr. Salas – and his supporters – maintains his innocence throughout, reportedly stating he had been tortured into a forced confession. Sadly, on June 18th, the regime hanged Mr. Salas in prison.', 'His death was part of a larger crackdown that began in February, when at least 300 Sufis demanding the release of their fellow faith members were unjustly arrested. Right now, hundreds of Sufi Muslims in Iran remain imprisoned on account of their religious beliefs, with reports of several having died at the hands of the regime’s brutal security forces.', 'Among those imprisoned is the 91-year-old leader, Dr. Noor Ali Tabandeh, who has been under house arrest for at least the last part of four months – the greatest part of four months. He is in need of immediate medical care.', 'The religious intolerance of the regime in Iran does not only extend to Sufi Muslims. The same goes for Christians and Jews and Sunnis and Baha’is and Zoroastrians and members of many other groups inside Iran who live with the fear that their next prayer may be indeed their last.', 'What grieves us so badly about the treatment of religious minorities in Iran is that their presence far pre-dates the regime. They are a historic part of the rich fabric of an ancient and vibrant Iranian civilization. That fabric has been torn by intolerant, black-robed enforcers. When other faiths are suppressed, the image of Iran becomes a self-portrait of the ayatollahs and of the IRGC.', 'In response to myriad government failures, corruption, and disrespect of rights, since December Iranians have been taking to the streets in the most enduring and forceful protests since 1979. Some shout the slogan, “The people are paupers while the mullahs live like gods.” Others choose to shut down the Grand Bazaar in Tehran. The specific grievances do differ, but all those voicing dissatisfaction share one thing: They have been ill-treated by a revolutionary regime. Iranians want to be governed with dignity, accountability, and respect. ', 'The regime – this is important. The regime’s brutal response to these peaceful protests reflects the intolerance that its revolutionary worldview has produced. Last January, the regime welcomed in the new year with the arrests of up to 5,000 of its own people. They were peacefully calling for a better life. Hundreds reportedly remain behind bars, and several are dead at the hands of their own government. The leaders cynically call it suicide.', 'Overall, it is clear the regime’s ideology has led many Iranians to be angry they cannot call their homeland a “normal” country.', 'They know that a constitution that enshrines the export of Islamic revolution and the destruction of its neighbors and the restriction of citizenship is not normal.', 'Ordinary Iranians know that their government’s torture of its own people is not normal.', 'Earning multiple rounds of sanctions by the UN Security Council is not normal.', 'Inciting chants of “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” is not normal.', 'Being the number one state sponsor of terror is similarly abnormal.', 'Sometimes it seems the world has become desensitized to the regime’s authoritarianism at home and its campaigns of violence abroad, but the proud Iranian people are not staying silent about their government’s many abuses.', 'And the United States under President Trump will not stay silent either. ', 'In light of these protests and 40 years of regime tyranny, I have a message for the people of Iran: The United States hears you; the United States supports you; the United States is with you.', 'When the United States sees the shoots of liberty pushing up through rocky soil we pledge our solidarity, because we too took a hard first step towards becoming a free country a few years back.', 'Right now, the United States is undertaking a diplomatic and financial pressure campaign to cut off the funds that the regime uses to enrich itself and support death and destruction.  We have an obligation to put maximum pressure on the regime’s ability to generate and move money, and we will do so.', 'At the center of this campaign is the re-imposition of sanctions on Iran’s banking and energy sectors.', 'As we have explained over the last few weeks, our focus is to work with countries importing Iranian crude oil to get imports as close to zero as possible by November 4th. Zero.', 'Recently – (applause). Recently, as part of this campaign, we designated the Bahraini Shia militia terrorist organization Saraya al-Ashtar, and with the UAE we have jointly disrupted a currency exchange network that was transferring millions of dollars to the IRGC.', 'And there’s more to come. Regime leaders – especially those at the top of the IRGC and the Quds Force like Qasem Soleimani – must be made to feel painful consequences of their bad decision making.  We are asking every nation, every nation who is sick and tired of the Islamic Republic’s destructive behavior, to join our pressure campaign. This especially goes for our allies in the Middle East and Europe, people who have themselves been terrorized by violent regime’s activity for decades.', 'And you should know that the United States is not afraid to spread our message on the airwaves and online inside of Iran either.  For 40 years the Iranian people have heard from their leaders that America is the “Great Satan.” We do not believe they are interested in hearing the fake news any longer. ', 'Today, one in four Iranians – 14 million people – watches or listens to U.S. Government broadcasts each week. And it’s more important than ever now to refute the regime’s lies and repeat our deep desire for friendship with the Iranian people. Right now, our U.S. Board – Broadcasting Board of Governors is taking new steps to help Iranians get around internet censorship as well. The BBG is also launching a new 24/7 Farsi-language TV channel. It will span not only television, but radio, digital, and social media format, so that the ordinary Iranians inside of Iran and around the globe can know that America stands with them. ', 'And finally – and finally, America is unafraid to expose human rights violations and support those who are being silenced.', 'We continue to raise our concerns over the Islamic Republic’s dire record of human rights abuses each time we speak at the UN and with our partners who maintain diplomatic relations with that country. We make it clear that the world is watching, and as the regime continues to make its own people the longest-suffering victims, we will not stand silent. ', 'And now we call on everyone here in the audience and our international partners to help us shine a spotlight on the regime’s abuses and to support the Iranian people.', 'The goal of our efforts is to one day see Iranians in Iran enjoying the same quality of life that Iranians in America enjoy. (Cheers and applause.)', 'Iranians in America enjoy all the freedoms secured by their government, not trampled by it. They are free to pursue economic opportunities they believe are best for them and their families, and they can be proud of their country and practice their faiths in the way they desire.', 'There are a few individuals with us I want to highlight tonight who embody what we hope for the Iranian people.', 'Goli Ameri came to the United States as a freshman at Stanford and has founded successful companies and has served at the State Department and at the UN.', 'Susan Azizzadeh was forced to leave everything behind and come here in 1979. Today she is the leader of the Iranian American Jewish Federation. (Cheers and applause.)', 'Makan Delrahim – I think I saw him – came to America with his family when he was just 10 years old.  He is now the Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice – quite amazing. ', 'We hope that the successes of Goli and Susan and Makan and the many others American – Iranian Americans among the diaspora in the United States remind all Iranians of what is possible under a government that respects its people and governs with accountability. Iranians should not have to flee their homeland to find a better life. ', 'While it is ultimately up to the Iranian people to determine the direction of their country, the United States, in the spirit of our own freedoms, will support the long-ignored voice of the Iranian people. Our hope is that ultimately the regime will make meaningful changes in its behavior both inside of Iran and globally. As President Trump has said, we’re willing to talk with the regime in Iran, but relief from American pressure will come only when we see tangible, demonstrated, and sustained shifts in Tehran’s policies.', 'I thought I’d close tonight in a perfectly appropriate way by invoking the words of a man who routinely made the case for freedom and respect far more eloquently than I ever could, President Ronald Reagan. In 1982 – (applause).', 'In 1982, President Reagan gave a speech to the British Parliament that became known as the Westminster address. He urged other Western governments to support those around the world trying to break free of tyranny and injustice. His reason why was simple and powerful. He said, “Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable right and universal right of every human being.”', 'This is why we also call on all governments to end their flirtations with a revolutionary regime and come quickly to the aid of the Iranian people.  On that same day in those same remarks, President Reagan said, “Let us ask ourselves: ‘What kind of people do we think we are?’ And let us answer, ‘Free people, worthy of freedom, and determined not only to remain so, but to help others gain their freedom as well.’”', 'Today, the United States condemns oppression levied on the Iranian people by those who rule unjustly, and we proudly amplify the voices of those in Iran longing to have those inalienable and universal human rights cease to be ignored and instead to be honored. We do so knowing that many in the streets and marketplaces speak for those who the regime has permanently silenced over the years – who may even have been loved ones who are in the audience tonight.', 'It’s America’s hope that the next 40 years of Iran’s history will not be marked by repression and fear – but with freedom and fulfillment – for the Iranian people.', 'Thank you.
